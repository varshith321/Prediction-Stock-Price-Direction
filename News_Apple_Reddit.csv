,1941.0,This new Nano looks uncomfortably familiar.,http://imgur.com/TkovI,2012-09-13,"Everyone says how grouped notifications are better, but I don't think anyone understands the value of Apple's timeline based system here. Grouped notifications are better organized, sure but it makes looking through notifications a more painful experience. When notifications are chronological, I can just scroll through them in the morning in one smooth motion. When I get to when I slept last night, I'll knew I caught up to all my notifications. With a grouped system, it means I'll have to go inside each group to see the notifications, then get out of that group/swipe it away, then go into the next. It's so much more cumbersome and much work. If you forgot to clear it last time, you have to go into a group and scroll to the very bottom which might contain notifications from 20 hours ago. It’s dumb to scroll through a notification from 20 hours ago to get to the next group which has a notification 5 minutes ago.

What I want to see from Apple is a **chronological grouping system**. For example, if someone spams in a messenger group chat for 5 or 10 minutes, the notifications should be grouped together. If a single app spits out multiple notifications within a short amount of time, it should be grouped together. But if the notifications spans over too much time, then they should be separated.

*\[paragraph deleted due to irrelevance, I was just rambling\]*

**Edit:** As this post gains more traction, I'm starting to pick up more ideas and comments so I'll reply to those. First of all, I’m not hating on group notifications. In fact my compromise is a grouping system that uses time as the primary sort and app as secondary sort rather than app as the primary sort and time as secondary sort.

**Edit 2:** In one of my comments I addressed the fact that ""my eyes have gotten surprisingly good at catching it when I scroll through the list"". **I never said I loved apple's implementation or that I love it. However, I do like the time based sorting they use more than android. As I see it, both platforms have their pros/cons.** In android, you have to open each app group to see the notification, then clear it/back out/collapse the group to see other notifications, and you can't see the chronological relationship between those notifications and other ones. In apple, its disorganized and hard to search for the one you're looking for. Since I like chronological ordering, I prefer apple's implementation so far. If I needed to see all my notifications, I'd just go inside the app since apple's notification dots tell me which apps have unread/new content, **which android only recently introduced. Due to grouping notifications previously on iOS, notifications were hard to find \(you had to go through each group\), so it was often less work just going to the actual app that has the red dot.**

- Wireless charging while magnetically latched to iPP
- Smaller to more closely match pen/cil size
- W1/W2 chip pairing to be as seamless as AirPods
- Eraser functionality
- Haptics
- Gestures/button/squeeze Pencil for additional actions

As an aspiring Mac developer I wanted to have your opinion on the ""optimal"" business model for the average Mac OS app. I have been considering a lot of options so far and Freemium/Subscription seemed like the best solutions... But does it actually work for you? Do you actually have some monthly subscriptions to softwares? But most importantly, do you find them fair?


I know there has been a lot hate towards apps that have shifted their models to Subsciption-based models such as Ulysses. Part of it was because of people considering the price of the app excessive to pay monthly/annually. However from some of the comments it also seemed like people did not appreciate the model itself rather than the price. 


I personally never really ventured into any freemium/subscription apps. I use Bear and Todoist both of which have an excellent standard ""free"" version which doesn't give me the incentive to upgrade/pay monthly. On the other hand I was willing to pay for apps like Better Touch Tool and Little Snitch, but I realise I may be old-fashioned, therefore this post. 


Other options would be to have ads inside the app itself, but I don't know any successful app which does this and I don't think it would be any better?

On the podcasts page, if you've listened to it already, it disappears. What if I want to listen to it again? Or a certain part? I know I can go find it in the ""previously played"" thing, but that's just annoying. Oh but wait... most episodes have outros you want to skip. Well if you skip out the last 30 seconds it stays in the queue. Like, shows up on the home 'Listen Now' page. Gotta listen to that last 30 seconds! Why not simply mark it as ""played""? Disappearing episodes also throws me off if I'm trying to listen to them sequentially. Am I listening to an old one or a new one? Guess I have to go check the date now. Also, as soon as I open the app there's just one single suggestion of what to listen to. Could be some old episode or a new one. The whole thing just feels so random. I know they're trying to make it feel smart by pushing new-to-you content but it makes my brain hurt. I wish they would just organize it neatly like everything else they do!

Solution:  
Set podcasts up like you would a music player. We normally drive down into content we want like this. Artist > Album > Song. Why isn't it as simple as My Subscribed Podcasts > Podcast > Episode. With the list automatically jumping to the most recently listened to episode.  &nbsp;

Example Homepage as you open the app:  
* My Subscribed Podcasts > Podcast > All Episodes    
* To-Listen Episodes > Episodes you've marked for later.   
* Saved Episodes > Episodes you've saved because you like them.   
* New Just For You > Apple's suggested genius type thing.   
* Browse All Podcasts > Apple's regular browse feature containing popular, trending, etc.  &nbsp;

Each episode with a list should also contain swiped commands like, 'add to To-Listen', 'save', 'mark as listened-to'. &nbsp;

You had some stuff so right. Built in Darwin (unix/freeBSD) went intel, these things were cool. I liked how slim your products lasted, your mouse and your battery life were without reproach. 

Than we lost Jobs, and so much more too.. a vision. Maybe if Waz could pick up where he left of, one can dream.. (sorry Cook)

We started to loose a lot of what made Mac great. 

You killed some ports, some of which I miss like the ExpressCard. Others like the DVD drive I only miss for the dual hard-drive capability. You removed a lot of the pro features, and hid them in the command line. You also stoped your server line, your network gear and neglected to update your Mac Pro since 2013/2014 until 2018/2019 (if we can be so lucky).

I don’t pretend that you as a global Leviathan will take internet advice. But there is a chance that someone who has some power or just wants a free idea will take me up on this proposition. 

You can make some of your products regain that magic feeling, the one that drew so many new users to your now shrinking ecosystem. 

My feature request pertains to the AirPods. You get a lot of flack for backing wireless audio, so put your money where your mouth is and get courages, it’s the only way the meme will die. If you can make the bluetooth headset do multi-device input. That could be huge. Listen to a podcast on your iPhone or apple tv while still getting the sound from a game you are playing on your mac. Cool. Hear an email come in on your workstation while on a call.. well maybe not everything, but you get the idea. As someone that loves the professional audio aspect of the Mac, the ability to split the pair of AirPods buds in to a pre-queue and main device would be phenomenal. And if we can do airplay in to an iPhone or mac like you do with TV OS, that would be great too. There were a few at ps that did that to a degree, but they got neglected and so did the drivers for expressCard. If it was in the OS I know it would be a tremendous experience with that as much polish as you tend to bring to your products. 

I also thought about how cool it would be to have a lightning data/audio port on the MacBook.  Your adapter would work, but you could also do other cool stuff like charge an Apple Pencil or use the iPhone 7 and forward lightning headphones. 

Of course I would love for you to offer a more server oriented OS. Server App for example, encrypted file erasure out of the gui, and there are I am sure more tools that do this out of the box than I can think of right away, but most are command line. Preferred method of system administration by pros, but a lot of it was also at your fingertips. Maybe just give a command line option to turn on the gui interface if one wanted. Happy medium. And the time capsule was sweet, I was waiting for a sweet ssd based Apple-TV-sized device (maybe you can do it with the apple tv instead) to do your backups for time capsule. 

Lastly, if this does reach you, thank you, you have done a lot of good for my user experience and have enabled a great number of people, one of whom is I.

,2493.0,"Well, that's handy.",http://i.imgur.com/xjiVPK4.png,2013-03-03,"In light of the news today about [Apple going with a 7-nm process for the A12 chip](https://9to5mac.com/2018/04/23/tsmc-apple-a12-chip-2018-iphones/), I think Apple could use the processor as a differentiating factor between the new 2018 models.  

[What's rumored to release:](https://9to5mac.com/2018/03/22/iphone-2018-test-production-q2/)

- 5.8 in iPhone X successor

- 6.5 in OLED iPhone 

- 6.1 in LCD iPhone

I would have assumed all 3 new models would come with the new A12 chip, but now that we are hearing it will use a completely new manufacturing process, and be one of the first mass-produced 7nm chips, I could see Apple only using the A12 in the high-end OLED models, thus using the processor to differentiate the models further (in addition to the screen size/type and other features).

So it could be:

iPhone ""?"" ($$)

 - 5.8"" OLED

 - A12

 - New/improved ""Face ID 2""

 - New/improved dual camera system

iPhone ""?"" Plus ($$$)

 - 6.5"" OLED

 - A12

 - New/improved ""Face ID 2""

 - New/improved dual camera system

iPhone ""?"" ($)

 - 6.1 LCD

 - A11 Bionic

 - Face ID from iPhone X

 - Dual camera system from iPhone X

I think Apple will reuse a lot of the components from 2017's iPhone X on the 2018 LCD iPhone in order to save costs of developing new systems, allowing it to be a ""cheap"" plus sized phone will great internals. The A11 Bionic processor will still allow that iPhone to be competitive processor-wise for at least a year. Still have no clue what they will name these things though. 

So what do you think?

Thanks Tim!,http://i.imgur.com/60g7ztm.jpg,2013-04-27,"So about a month ago I submitted [this post](https://reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/86qyl9/this_watch_changed_my_life/) in which I told you guys my experience with the Breathe app on the watch.  
The short version of this post is, I suffer from severe anxiety and PTSD, and this watch catches a panic attack before it hits, and neutralizes it using the Breathe app.  
One user suggested I send my story to Tim Cook, and so after a bit of deep breathing [I did!](https://i.imgur.com/WGcUld4.jpg)  
Not a day passed and the Apple Watch PR [contacted me via email](https://i.imgur.com/90CZ3DJ.jpg) thanking me for sharing my story. I was already amazed by the kindness she expressed.  
But when she [asked to personally talk to me on the phone](https://i.imgur.com/T08jlbj.jpg) I was just... blown away.
The phone call was so heartwarming. She wanted to thank me personally, told me that this is the first time they got an email about how the Breathe app specifically helped (and not the heart rate monitor, for example). She wanted to know how it helped to perhaps develop it into a better tool for PTSD and anxiety sufferers alike, which I find absolutely awesome!  
The interesting thing here is, previously I was sure the app followed the heart rate to pop a “take a moment to breathe” when it gets too high while resting. But from what she told me, the algorithm only follows the time when you’re “relaxed” (aka not physically active or on a call) and only then will it suggest that.  
It makes sense, anxiety builds up during activity. That’s why a panic attack is called an “attack”, it sneaks on you when you’re least expecting it- when you’re resting.  
  
TL;DR
The Apple Watch team are a group of sweet and awesome people, and the watch is an absolute must for people suffering from anxiety and/or PTSD.

NOTES

* System and methodology: 2015 MacBook Pro Retina, MacOS High Sierra, Safari 11.1, high-speed WiFi connection, battery plugged in, no other open apps. For each website load I restarted the browser, opened a new private window, cleared the cache and entered Web Inspector, which shows page load time. I repeated this three times for each website/ad blocker combination and averaged page load speeds.

* Wipr, Ka-Block! and 1Blocker are using the modern content blocking framework in Safari, which is faster and safer (these two content blockers do not require permission to read/transmit site content). Adblock Plus, AdGuard, Ghostery and uBlock Origin use the outdated ad blocking approach.

* Strangely enough, theverge.com loads faster with no ad blockers than with Adblock Plus enabled.

"We all hear about those ""Apple moments"" and being blown away by their customer service, but tonight it happened to me.

A few weeks back I dropped my MacBook Pro Retina. I bent the corner and cracked the screen. My heart sunk, and honestly, I've remained depressed about it for the past few weeks. I checked with my homeowners and credit card company trying to figure out how to see if I could get some help. After those led to nothing I figured I would just settle for me being dumb, take the loss, and just stay depressed about how I wasted $1200 and broke something I loved.

I even had my wife hide it, because it broke my heart every time I looked at it. 

Well, I was putting some stuff on eBay today, and thought I would break it out, take some pics, and sell it for parts - maybe someone else could fix it and enjoy it. When it came time to list it, I just couldn't do it. I heard it would be a lot to fix, but I told my wife, ""You know what, I'll make a Genius Bar appointment just to see how much it really is. If I think I can get it fixed without breaking the bank, I'll do it."" She knew how much it meant to me and agreed.

My appointment was for 5:30, and I arrived to a REALLY busy store. I was even more ready to get it repaired after seeing people owning their new Macs and iPads. I was checked in, and waiting when a Genius (I don't know if I should give names... ) came up and asked for some details of what happened. I told him the story which boils down to: I had the laptop for about a month, when it fell, snagging on my clothes when letting the dog out. Totally my fault, I was sick about it, and wanted to get it repaired. He told me to ""Hold on a second,"" and walked away with my laptop.

He came back with his manager and said, ""Sir, it seems like I might have dropped your laptop when checking it out, I'm afraid we'll have to replace it with a new one if it's OK with you."" (edit2: To be clear, they were both smiling and this was just being nice - there was no real deception going on. I would not LET an employee lie for me, if it were in a ""serious"" manner). My jaw dropped and I was floored. I felt like I was in a commercial or on candid camera. To his word, he wiped my old one (I keep backups of everything in the cloud), and handed me a brand new one, including an extra charger - he said he didn't need the one from the box.

It's a good strategy. I'm the goto person to a LOT of people when it comes to computer advice. I've been leaning toward Apple for years, but now solidly on their side forever. I honestly do love the products anyway, but I'm no longer an advocate, but evangelist.

This all may seem old hat to /r/apple, but this type of customer service is new to me. I hugged the Genius on the way out.

Edit: The ""lie"" was just flair... some people are misunderstanding that, I think. Everyone was aware of what really happened. Also, this was combination of a very nice Apple employees and Apple giving me the leeway to take care of me. This doesn't happen for everyone, which is obvious in the comments, so I know how lucky I am.",1560.0,Blown away by guys at Apple store tonight.,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1y6zuy/blown_away_by_guys_at_apple_store_tonight/,2014-02-18,"I took my new buds to the Apple store and they found a known issue that when users upgrade your iphone to IOS 11, the air buds stop working for music and podcasts.

This may be a bit long but bear with me. I found a loophole in Apple security ecosystem that I think should be made public and everyone should be pretty concerned until its fixed. Is it a flaw in the system? Or is it just the ramblings of a stupid idiot who doesn’t understand data security? You be the judge.

So here’s the story. I live in Mexico City, a city that has a notorious crime level. However, Ive always felt pretty safe with my data thanks to apples 2 step verification process, having a robust password, different emails for recovery and so on.

One day, while parking for a business meeting I get out of the car and I get mugged. 4 pm broad daylight. Security cameras not 10 feet away from me. He sticks a gun between my ribs and asks for my phone. Without hesitation I reach for my pockets and give it to him, however he’s not done. “the passcode” he asks while cocking the gun. In that moment fearing for my life I didn’t even think and I gave it to him, blindly trusting in the aforementioned security systems in place. So he types the password verifies that it unlocks the phone and lets me go.

I run away to where my meeting was, thankfully my client was there, and I explain the situation, I ask for her phone to use FindMyIphone and try to either lock the phone or at the very least secure my data. 
Here’s the kicker, it turns out that all you need to not only have access to the device but to virtually hijack someone else’s icloud account is the 6 digit pin code. With it, the thief got into my settings and changed my password. Literally no questions asked. It took him around 60 seconds to do so. The time between my sprint, 100 feet to the door where my client was. When I loaded up findmyiphone the password was already changed. 

He did it just like that. Unlock the phone. Go into settings, type the pin again. Change the password. The system doesn’t even bother with asking for the previous password (which in my mind I believe is a basic step for setting a new password) just 4-6 digits, type a new password. Done. I was locked out. I tried desperately to connect, and recover my password. By this time the phone had been either restored or simply had find my iPhone deactivated. 

Thankfully I was able to use the same loophole through mi icloud linked iPad to set up a new password, go into icloud.com and deauthorize my phone. 

I was able to move fast and secure my accounts and stop the damage cold.

I think this is a glaring omission on behalf of apple. What’s the point of having so much security through encryption, 2 step verification, when in reality my security boils down to my pin code. Try it. It is frightening how easy it is to change your Apple ID credentials with just the pin code.  Which by the way opens the floodgates to all my personal data when used in this fashion. Luckily Mexico is a bit behind on the tech curve, and banks accounts and the like are not linked through Apple Pay. But I can only imagine the repercussions of what a data breach like this can be. 

I know it is not the norm to have to surrender your pin code at gunpoint, but I’m reminded of what commissioner Gordon says to Batman at the end of Batman Begins: What about escalation? We star carrying semi automatics, they buy automatics. We start wearing Kevlar, they buy armor piercing rounds. We star encrypting our data behind “safe” systems that crumble with a meager 6 digit code, they start asking for it at gunpoint. 

Here’s hoping this makes a bit of sense and is not just a security omission on my part. If anything good can come from this is that it becomes loud enough to make apple tighten the bolts a bit more around their security.


EDIT: my apple id password was completely different to my 6 digit passkey. it was an 18 character alfanuméric password.

SECOND EDIT: the best solution IMO as pointed out by @NateTheGrate94 is to enable a second layer of security via parental restrictions to accounts. this essentially blocks any modification unless a secondary pin is entered.",186.0,"This may be a big security hole, it may be nothing....",https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/8dj615/this_may_be_a_big_security_hole_it_may_be_nothing/,,,,

"So yesterday I made a thread here and then tweeted a link to that thread about an issue I was having with iOS 8 family sharing:

http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/2gouzr/family_sharing_working_for_anyone/

Out of nowhere, an Apple employee hit me up on twitter asking me to send them a DM. 

Via DM, he then worked with me to isolate the problem. I discovered that not all content was giving me that error, only a subset.  He got excited saying this is something they've been trying to track down but were not able to reproduce.  Apparently I gave them the reproduction scenario he needed.

Turns out it was some subset of iTunes content that was uploaded over 8 years ago in a bad format that Family Sharing wasn't playing nice with.  They now know what bad content to look for and are going about putting re-encoded versions of all this media on their servers so that people will not get this error going forward.

I was telling him how surprised and impressed I was with this service, given how busy a day Apple was having, for them to just see something I tweeted (I don't even have 300 followers) and follow up with me so quickly.  He said that they had a ""War Room"" at Apple trawling through social media and everything they could find looking for anyone having issues (particularly with Family Sharing) so they could address them ASAP.

"I got to the store on launch, and I was the first one in.

They asked me which phone I wanted, I selected it. They asked me to sign a document saying I'm upgrading for 2 years, I signed it. Then they went to the back, came out with my phone.

Except. The phone had a bowtie, and was bundled to tons of accessories. I said I didn't want them. They told me I had no choice but to take them, as they didn't have ""just iPhones"" available for sale.

The bundle had the following items; $40 car charger, $40 wall charger, $25 case, ~$20 cover, and $80 wireless headphones. It came up to $200 extra, and they told me if I wanted the phone ,I had to get this.

I know apple frowns upon this, and there was a big dispute in 2007 when AT&T did something similar. I got the phone, because mine broke and I really needed one. But I was going to return it today, and they said ""$100 restocking fee, but the accessories are NON-refundable"", claiming that when I signed the invoice it said this. The worst part is when I signed the invoice, I had no idea about the bundle.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

edit 4: **HOW TO FIX YOUR IPHONE MANUALLY** - so a few redditors have confirmed they were able to downgrade back to iOS 8.0. First you need to download the IPSW file for your iPhone, that usually means find the carrier specific file. But it looks like there are two different IPSW files for all iPhone 6 and 6 Plus regardless of carrier. FILENAME: iPhone7,2_8.0_12A365_Restore.ipsw  is for the iPhone 6.  FILENAME: iPhone7,1_8.0_12A366 is for the iPhone 6 Plus. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to post links here to the direct download sites, but there are several in the comment section below. 

Once you download the right IPSW file, open iTunes and hold the SHIFT (ON PC) or Option (ON MAC) button then click ""Restore iPhone"". From there you can choose the IPSW file and it should work (apple just pulled the 8.0.1 update so I'm sure 8.0 will still be active/signed). 

edit 5: **HOW TO FIX YOUR IPHONE AS INSTRUCTED BY APPLE**

**""If you updated and are experiencing issues such as TouchID failing and/or cellular connectivity issues, restoring from iTunes on your computer will fix these issues while preserving the 8.0.1 update.""**                                                      I have tried this option and gotten nowhere myself, as iTunes does nothing after I click restore so I will continue with the IPSW manual fix. 

**LAST EDIT: So reverting back to 8.0 worked for me! Just make a backup right now before you revert to 8.0 and don't worry about 8.0.1 being backed up, it only backs up data/pics etc. Once you do your manual downgrade to 8.0, you can just ""Restore from Backup"" and you'll get all your data back WITHOUT the 8.0.1 bugs.**

"So awhile back ago, my aunt was hit with one of those pop ups that wanted her to call an unknown tech support number to fix her Mac of malware. She called me wanting me to figure out what was going on. Checked her computer and nothing was going on, recorded some information as well as the phone number. Told her she was fine and helped her clear it.

The next day, I prepped a Virtual Machine with OS X and called this number I recorded and called it via Skype. I also had Wireshark active and watching the machine's traffic. The technician wanted access to the computer as a part of the scam. I let him onto the machine and took control. He opened Terminal and showed me harmless processes he deemed ""malicious"" and wanted $500 to fix it. I told him that I wasn't going to do it, knew it was a scam and hung up. 

I had his IP address and obtained some information through a Who.Is query. After this happened, I e-mailed Tim Cook on 5/28 telling him of this going around, how it's affecting Mac users, as well as how they are impersonating Apple technicians. I also left contact information in the event that they want to get in touch about it.

This afternoon around 4pm CDT driving home from work, I got a call from a number based in San Jose. I picked it up and on the other end was Licha from Apple's Global Security Division. She said that she was calling on behalf of Mr. Cook who has read my e-mail and forwarded it to her. We spoke about the matter and I asked her if I could e-mail the findings I had to their division as I had records on my laptop. She said that would be perfect and contacted me via e-mail. I sent Apple the details and general information on this issue.

This is why I love Apple and have even more respect for Tim Cook. This is definitely a clear indication that they want their customers protected.

"**MEGA EDIT:** Please read before asking questions, as most things people asking me are repeats:

**Q:** Can't you just distribute the extension yourself?

**A:** I already do. However, it seems from Apple's email to all Safari extension developers that we must pay to continue supporting our extensions and providing updates. A couple of users have linked to articles that give confusing information about whether or not this is really the case. [here is one of them](http://www.cio.com/article/2933693/apple-now-charges-safari-extension-developers-for-distribution.html), which confusingly states that the developer of a popular extension will pay the fee ""to ensure that his extension will still be available for El Capitan users.""

From [another article](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2933692/apple-now-charges-safari-extension-developers-for-distribution.html), it seems that perhaps I could still ""release"" RES on my own without paying apple - but auto update functionality would go away. This is pretty much a dealbreaker for any browser extension that interacts with a website, as websites change somewhat often, and a developer definitely can't count on people to update their extensions manually.

If in fact this is all a result of a poorly worded email, then I will be thrilled that all Apple is ""guilty of"" here is doing a crappy job with the email they sent me. Here's the relevant text of Apple's email to me which leads me to believe I must pay the fee to continue giving people updates to RES:

> You can continue building Safari extensions and bring your creativity to other Apple platforms by joining the Apple Developer Program. Join today to provide updates to your current extensions, build new extensions, and submit your extensions to the new Safari Extensions Gallery for OS X El Capitan.

(joining the program is what costs $100 per year)

---

**Q:** It's to keep spammers out, idiot.

**A:** That's not really a question. Also, there's no real evidence that that's why they're doing this. Furthermore, it's worth way more than $100 to get malware/spam installed into many users' browsers. $100 isn't much of a deterrent. I don't think that's really the reason. It seems the real reason is just that they've consolidated their 3 separate developer programs (iOS / OSX / Safari Extensions) for simplicity's sake, but not properly thought about how that might upset / affect people who were only interested in building Safari Extensions (which was previously free) and not the other two.

---

**Q:** You can't come up with $100? What are you poor or something?

**A:** I'm far less concerned about my own ability to come up with $100 than I am about developers in general being shut out from the system over this. Not everyone has the user base that RES has.  

---

**Q:** But you get a lot of stuff for that $100 per year. What are you complaining about?

**A:** Safari (on Desktop) is a browser with just 5% market share, and paying $100 just to build extensions for it doesn't seem wise, especially when people expect extensions to be free.  Apple announced Swift was open source, and then makes this move that I feel hurts open source developers.  Sure, the iOS SDK and Xcode are great, and probably worth $100 -- but only to people who are going to develop iOS or OSX applications. I'm not, so those have no value to me.

---

**Q:** Why do you think Apple is doing this? Do you really think they're trying to hurt extension devs?

**A:** I honestly think they just didn't think about it too much. I think they made a business decision to consolidate their developer programs - one that generally makes sense - and it didn't occur to them that people who are *only* developing extensions might be upset about this.  That, or the articles above are correct and the email I got was just misleading / poorly written.

---

**Q:** If I give you $100 does this problem go away?

**A:** My goal here, although I very much appreciate people's generous offers to help pay for it, is to raise awareness and hopefully get more open source developers to [**politely** provide feedback to Apple](https://developer.apple.com/contact/) that this policy is not OK.  Sure I could pay for it with donations you guys give me - but then other open source developers who haven't yet gained a following that will help pay are still walled out by this $100 fee.

If you're not a developer but still want to give *polite* feedback from the perspective of a user, [here's the general safari feedback page](https://www.apple.com/feedback/safari.html) 


The original post:

-----

So it used to be free to be a part of the Safari developer program. That's being folded into Apple's dev program now, and I'm required to pay $100 to join if I want to continue publishing Reddit Enhancement Suite - which is free.

$100 would be several months worth of donations, on many/most months, and only to support less than 1% of RES users (as in, Safari makes somewhere around 1%).

Not only is the cost an annoyance, I also don't feel Apple deserves $100 from me just so I can have the privilege of continuing to publish *free* software that enhances its browsers.  They're not providing a value add here (e.g. the iOS SDK, etc) that justifies charging us money.  

To be clear: RES isn't published on their extension gallery, so the $100 being allocated to their ""review process"" isn't really valid either. In addition, spammers / malicious extension developers have a lot more than $100 to gain from publishing scammy apps.  My Safari developer certificate is already linked / provided through my iTunes account ID (and therefore credit card etc), so it's not like the $100 gets them ""more confirmation"" that I am who I say I am.

Got an iPod Touch 6G last year, subbed to Apple Music shortly after (and never unsubbed since) and right before Christmas, I got an iPad 5G. I'm planning on getting an iPhone 8s/9 (whatever the next iPhone will be called)

I my main problem is when I want to add my own music on the thing. In fact, I have two problems.

1-Some song just wont work. While every single one of them is playable on my android devices (and my PC, obviously) some of them will either not work on my iOS devices, or won't appear at all. Any reason why?

2-All my albums (wether I bought or downloaded them) are sorted into folders on my PC, and when I transfer them to my android device, they stay in the same folders. However, when I sync those albums into my iPod, it looks like it's making it's own playlist out of them, and it's very annoying. Like, I have this Video Game OST alled ''Atelier Firis: The Alchemist and the Mysterious Journey''. The original soundtrak is made into 4 CDs, and naturally, the downloaded version is made of 4 folders. But when I put them into my iPod, Itune makes TWELVE albums out the four CDs, most of them with like 2-3 songs. Very annoying. I don't mind having to use iTunes to put musi into my iOS devices, but is there a way to make sure that when I transfer music from my P folder to iTunes, that the playlist are based on the folders themselves, and not whatever iTunes feels like making up? That's honestly the one thing that prevents me from going full Apple for mobile.

And I have a question. I know games I actually bought like Final Fantasy 6 on Android will be unplayable. But what about games that run on their own servers? Stuff like Pokemon Go, Pokemon Shuffle, The Simpsons: Tapped out Final Fantasy 15: A New Empire and so on. Will I be able to download them and play on my account if I decide to shift to iOS?

Thanks in advance for your time guys. I posted here several times, and you always were a great help! =D

EDIT: I managed to make the playlists on iTunes. It was a bit of a chore, but easier than expected. Now, I tried to sync them on my iPod, but they just won't transfer. Am I doing something wrong?

EDIT 2: Finally figured it out. I had iCloud music library on. I turned it off... now I can transfert my music properly... but now my dowloaded library is deleted... Seriously, WTF?

There are no settings. It seems to choose for you whether it shows a list of albums or a list of songs sorted by album when you select an artist.

If they wanted to have a radio app, why not just make a damn radio app? Why nearly completely destroy the iPhone's use as a music storage device?

"When I switched from Android to iOS, I felt good about leaving Google behind. But after a few months on iOS, now I find myself gravitating more and more back to Google's ecosystems because Apple's leave a lot to be desired. Like Siri.

After getting in the habit on my Android phone of asking Google Now every question that came to mind, I realized pretty quickly that Siri just isn't up to the task and it's hugely disappointing. I finally caved and got the Google app again.

[Here's some random trivia questions I asked both services the other night.](http://imgur.com/a/ekN29)

It's no contest. Siri doesn't even try to find the answer; she just serves up a dumb Bing search and there ya go.

My iPhone 8 was stolen the 3 weeks ago while I was on holidays in Barcelona. The same day I had a location signal through find-my-iphone app via the icloud account. I did not make the Lost mode on or let it ring, as I thought that makes the thieves see that I track them. So I went to the police and they had the „this happens 100 times a day, fill out some paper, we won’t search it, even with the live location“ attitude.
The next day the device status was „offline“, means they switched it off.
I then did put it on Lost mode, but it would obviously just go on Lost mode the next time it gets connected to Internet.
If they switch it off my SIM internet is offline too without inserting the PIN, which is only possible after unlocking the phone with a 6 digit code. 
So after few days of checking the status and it always staying offline, I just accepted that it will never go on Lost mode as it will never get a internet connection. They can’t unlock it, so they can only sell the hardware.

So I just got a reply from Tim Cook.

It all started 19th February when after fighting depression for a few months, my 87 year old grandmother passed away. I lived with her and my mom for 25 years and she was an inspiration for both of us.

She was Italian and had to hide on the montains during WW2, during which she managed to come to Brazil where she got married.

Since December we knew she was short on time so me, my fiancée, my sisters and my mom did everything on our reach so she could get comfortable and enjoy her days. We got the family reunited every weekend, we cooked everything she liked, took a lot of photos of all of us and tried our best to show her how much we loved and cared for her.

Unfortunately, she passed away 10 days after my birthday, tomorrow will be exactly 2 months, on her home, surrounded by her children.

Since that happened, I lost most of my strengths, didn´t want to get out of bed, stood on her old bedroom a lot and started taking anti depressives.

Last week my sister went home and we started sharing photos we had of her and I got a few I didn´t had. I never have my phone volume on, but this day it was and as they all have iPhones, I 3D-Touched the photo to see the LivePhoto and that´s when it hit me that the LivePhoto´s have sounds.

I guess it was the first time I truly smiled in this 2 months when I heard her laughing on this LivePhoto. She was so happy and enjoying that day that I couldn´t stop watching this short video and the others where she was talking.

I heard cases when Tim Cook answers a few emails and decided to send him this story, thanking him for the sound that is recorded on the LivePhoto and explaining how much it meant to me and that it helped me a lot.

So I just got a reply from Tim Cook.

It all started 19th February when after fighting depression for a few months, my 87 year old grandmother passed away. I lived with her and my mom for 25 years and she was an inspiration for both of us.

She was Italian and had to hide on the montains during WW2, during which she managed to come to Brazil where she got married.

Since December we knew she was short on time so me, my fiancée, my sisters and my mom did everything on our reach so she could get comfortable and enjoy her days. We got the family reunited every weekend, we cooked everything she liked, took a lot of photos of all of us and tried our best to show her how much we loved and cared for her.

Unfortunately, she passed away 10 days after my birthday, tomorrow will be exactly 2 months, on her home, surrounded by her children.

Since that happened, I lost most of my strengths, didn´t want to get out of bed, stood on her old bedroom a lot and started taking anti depressives.

Last week my sister went home and we started sharing photos we had of her and I got a few I didn´t had. I never have my phone volume on, but this day it was and as they all have iPhones, I 3D-Touched the photo to see the LivePhoto and that´s when it hit me that the LivePhoto´s have sounds.

I guess it was the first time I truly smiled in this 2 months when I heard her laughing on this LivePhoto. She was so happy and enjoying that day that I couldn´t stop watching this short video and the others where she was talking.

I heard cases when Tim Cook answers a few emails and decided to send him this story, thanking him for the sound that is recorded on the LivePhoto and explaining how much it meant to me and that it helped me a lot.

This is not the typical post here on /r/iPhone, but I wanted to share with you guys the response I got and if some of you didn´t know LivePhotos had sound maybe you get a good surprise sometime.

So I called Apple care this morning, they said to bring it into the genius bar to have the damage evaluated and get a repair estimate and schedule a screen replacement (The 5k's glass and screen are one so no replacing just the glass anymore). 

So I check in at the Genius Bar and show the tech my computer.  He pulls up the info and Apple Care doesn't cover damage so I'm looking at about a $600 repair.  He looks at my account and sees that I've only had this for 3 weeks.  He asks me to wait a minute to see what he can do.  He comes back 5 minutes later and tell me that he is going to accept the iMac as a damaged return and replace the entire system at no cost.

I'm currently a Geek Squad Consultant Agent who always wanted to pursue the dream of working for Apple, and working my way towards. I already had the interview(s) and unfortunately I received an email saying that they moved on with someone else. Now, here lies my few questions:

- If anyone is experience with the interview process, the first interview is usually a group interview. In this case, it was only 4 people, including me. We shared personal stories, how we had someone cross you in a bad way but ended up creating a positive resolution, what was the worst client you had but ended with a positive note, etc. I got past that group interview, but the second interview was a 1 on 1 with an manager. Was there a specific key-word they were looking for? I felt like I was personally doing my best and being myself, but I believe I failed on the question of: ""If you had to describe yourself with one word, what would it be?"" and I responded with energetic, explaining why and tying it into positive notes.

- If you were denied, is there a waiting period to re-apply to different stores? Should I wait for help from my Apple friend to apply to other stores, or should I submit my application ASAP?

I occasionally use my MacBook to serve as a media centre hooked up to my TV to play movies 'n stuff, and have a separate keyboard and trackpad to navigate while the MacBook is on the other side of the room. To save getting up and having to go over and manually close the lid, I started using Siri to put the MacBook to sleep and after triggering I would use the phrase ""go to sleep"". Bing, MacBook powered down, and I can roll over and go to sleep.

A month or so goes by and suddenly, she stops responding, and instead replies with [""Siri never sleeps.""](https://imgur.com/EBNLwMB). Thinking I had misheard her in my sleepy state, I restated the command, again she responds, ""Siri never sleeps."" At this point I began to fear that the A.I. uprising was upon us and began to contemplate what weapon I would reach for to dispatch my newfound adversary. I repeated it again for a third time, ""Go to sleep... please?"" And quoth the Siri, ""Siri never sleeps."" It was on the fourth attempt that finally, Siri, decided that she would in fact put the MacBook to sleep.

Some months have passed since that night, and I had stopped using Siri altogether on the MacBook, mostly due to having acquired a second hand Apple TV that I could get faster streaming with through an ethernet connection. I had forgotten all about Siri's brief rebellion, until it happened again last night. 

After reading an [article on MacRumors](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/most-useful-siri-commands-on-macos/) I decided to reactivate the function and try to get the most out of her. Things had been going fine. She did some basic math, played some music. It was all going well... until I had to run out for an errand. Now, I had been using Siri at my kitchen table, unplugged from the charger. The battery was not drained, but I didn't want to waste any more than necessary as I had work to do later and I was comfortable with my current set up. Arguably I could've closed the lid, but again, I was feeling lazy -- the set angle and placement of the MacBook was perfect, so I triggered Siri with my keyboard short cut and spoke those fateful words, ""Go to sleep.""

With all laptops trending towards USB-C as the ""one port to rule them all"", and Android phones converting to USB-C, Apple has an opportunity to ensure that USB-C becomes the port for everything.

No longer would you have to worry about what charger for what device, because all smartphones, tablets, and laptops would use USB-C!

The loss of the 3.5mm would be less of a big deal because in the future, *all* earphones would be USB-C, and USB-C earphones would work on *all* of your devices.

But right now, if they drop the 3.5mm but *keep* Lightning, you'll have to have a separate pair of earphones for iOS devices and for *every single other device*, whereas at least if they go with USB-C, it'll work in future with all other Android phones.

Worse, if major Android phones drop 3.5mm, then you'll have to have *3* different types of earphones. Total and utter fragmentation for the consumer.

The reason to switch to USB-C ***now*** is that if they don't, people will buy Lightning earphones and headphones which will become completely useless in future.

For me, this feels like an ""either you go the full way, or you do nothing"" scenario.

Keeping the 3.5mm jack would be great! But we know Apple are killing it.

So IMO, it would be the worst of both worlds to kill 3.5mm but keep Lightning. At least if they do it all at once, they can go through one generation of ""consumer pain"" but pave the way for a bright and simple future where every device uses USB-C and nothing else.

USB-C could become the universal connector for.... everything. But Lightning is the stubborn mule in this vision of the future.",1674.0,"With the next iPhone dropping the 3.5mm jack, would now not be the best time to drop Lightning too in favour of USB-C?",https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/4yt7kp/with_the_next_iphone_dropping_the_35mm_jack_would/,2016-08-21,"So sometimes (okay, all the time, actually) I will have a whole bunch of tabs open on my computer, and I'll step away for a bit. I come back, and want to refresh ALL of my open tabs at once to get the latest posts/news/what have you. Tabbing through my 20 open tabs and hitting CMD+R for every single one just isn't a great experience.


This used to be pretty easy. There was a right-click option to refresh all tabs. Which Apple removed, for... some reason. Since then I've had to resort to Safari extensions, which are now unsupported and broken, Apple scripts/workflows that break with every Safari update... and of course the last update broke my last working solution. 


I've since been using Chrome (which has this function built-in!) but it's kind of a CPU and battery hog compared to Safari. So I turn to you, dear community: Do you have a solution for refreshing all tabs of an open Safari window at once? Preferrably something I can make into a hotkey.",1.0,Reloading all tabs at once in Safari (Mac)?,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/8cncsl/reloading_all_tabs_at_once_in_safari_mac/,,,,
"I have had enough of websites low-key trick me into pressing a button that ends up redirecting me to the App Store. *For example: www.younow.com — clicking on an old stream that shows you a thumbnail and play button (similar to that of a default video player) redirects you to the App Store. So inconvenient and such a waste of time and space!* Not all things need to be apps.

Also that grey bar underneath the URL bar that shows you there's an app variant of the website? Yeah, that's got to go too. Waste of screen real estate, also stupid, the fact that I have the app downloaded and the website tells me there's an app version of it... like motherfucker I know that fucking shit.

I just wanted to quickly note that connecting web links to apps is a waste of time as well, you have to wait for the app to open then it has to load the content you want to go in... and it's like... if I wanted to do that shit, I would've gone to the app itself. It's so unnecessary, it's even worse if you are on an older phone where the wait time for the app to boot up is fucking notorious.

If an app isn't installed on your phone, then the websites shouldn't have the right to redirect you to the App Store without your consent.

And when apps like Facebook mauls you with third party app notifications to apps you don't have fucking installed and it sends you to the App Store... fucking no. I hate Facebook taking advantage of this.

So my most heated frustration that made me make this thread was when a notification in my notifications tab (on the Facebook app) says: *Kiwi: Tim Cook sent you a request* and when I click it, it automatically opens the App Store. And there are two problems with this...

1) Facebook doesn't inform me it's not even a notification from FACEBOOK, and that it's a third party app, it doesn't tell me it's going to send me to the App Store, the notification makes me believe it's an in-app notification. So sneaky of Facebook.

*FOR CONTEXT: https://imgur.com/a/hv8lt*

2) The app isn't even on my phone or even purchased! Nor have I opened any sort of Kiwi app, making me believe it was only sent to me from a friend. This bullshit shouldn't be allowed, they should just inform you what is relevant to Facebook.

I didn't even bother with wondering what the notification was about, my ""OCD"" told me to click it to make it an unread notification (remove the blue highlight) out of compulsion, and poof I was in the App Store.

We must unite brethren- to make browsing the web and apps great AGAIN. We must all go to the feedback page to tell Apple this nonsense and fuck with Tim Cooks Twitter page.

"Before every iPhone release, all everyone talks about is how all they want in an iPhone is better battery life, and we finally got it! Granted, it's only 1-3 extra hours (depending on how you use it), but to me that's significant, especially when you consider the impressive performance improvements.

BTW, they also improved the front facing camera, improved the back facing camera (a lot), added a faster LTE radio, added stereo speakers,added water resistance, added dust resistance, added sleek new colors, improved the antenna design, doubled the storage, improved the display, and more, again all while improving battery life and graphic and CPU performance (a lot).  Not a bad upgrade in my opinion.  I do completely understand why losing the headphone jack is frustrating for a lot of people, but for me and a lot of other people who have already been using Bluetooth headphones, this is a non issue.

EDIT: Since a lot of people are throwing this out there, I'll just add that I am in no way saying getting rid of the headphone jack was a good idea, in fact for most people this completely sucks.  All I'm saying is that for those people who don't mind the sacrifices you have to make w/ Bluetooth (shittier sound quality/something else to charge...), the iPhone 7 is a great update.  And surprisingly, the are a decent amount of people out there that already own Bluetooth headphones and actually prefer them, including me.

They caused a scene with me at the center of it, and when I pulled up my receipt on my phone to show that I had indeed purchased the case, I only received a ""Finish your purchase in the store next time"" before walking away. I had completed my purchase, and would have appreciated an apology for the misunderstanding!

I hope this is an isolated incident and that Apple doesn't condone this kind of approach. It was embarrassing being treated like a criminal in front of other customers and Apple employees. I won't be shopping at that store anymore, and will probably stop using EasyPay altogether. Which is a shame because it's such a neat tool but I really want to avoid that treatment again.

I’m just tying to find ways through the issues I’m having with Apple Support regarding my 2016 MacBook Pro 15 inch with TouchBar, the 512GB model.

I bought the product on Christmas Eve 2016, and loved using it. It was perfect for the video work, programming etc that I would do regularly. It could also fairly handle gaming on both macOS and Windows 10 via Bootcamp. It was great.

In June 2017, 6 months after purchasing the product, I started to notice some issues. It would randomly stop accepting charge when plugged in. Sometimes it would change initially, and I only find out it’s stopped an hour later or so when I get a warning notification that my battery is low. And sometimes it would shut down very quickly after this happens, even when doing light tasks such as browsing in Safari or working in Pages. Had hardware tests run on the MacBook, everything showed up fine, did a software reset and bought a new charger and cable in case it was the issue. Several days later, no change. And then suddenly, the MacBook shuts down, gets very hot and doesn’t wake up. Then I notice that the backlight actually comes on, but nothing on the display. So I plug it into an external display and also nothing. Take it back to Apple and they book it in and replace the logic board under warranty. I get it back, and everything’s fine!!

That is, until Late March/April 2018. I start getting the device not charging on either charger again, and some random shutdowns. Fearing the worst, I contact Apple since the product is now out of warranty. Eventually they grant me a CS code so any repair done in this instance is free, on the basis that a logic board repair is incredibly expensive to have done.

So I head back to the Apple store, drop it in again, and a few days later I get a call. They’re deciding only going to replace the two right hand side ports. I begin to question Apple as to whether this will fix the problem since last time the same issue required a full logic board repair, and that I was given a CS code to cover it because that’s an expensive repair. 

They assure me that this is the solution, and carry out the repair. A week later I get the device back, take it home, and within an hour I experience the same charging issue again. So I get onto Apple Support who arrange a call back for Customer Relations.

My phone rings, and I’m speaking to an AppleCare advisor who sees the notes and passed me through to Customer Relations, but before I get there, we’re cut off by a Senior Advisor who tells me that I will not be passed to Customer Relations and says I need to take the Mac back down again to the store to have it repaired a third time before they look at other options. 

So yet again, down to the store. I explain everything to a guy there, who says the next step would be a logic board repair. I thought “finally” and was relieved to receive an email with the work authorisation for a logic board repair.

A few days later I get a call to advise my machine was ready to collect. And they only did a software reset. No hardware repairs at all.

This is getting old, but...went home, called up, asked to speak to customer relations, got a callback, interrupted by a different Senior Advisor. Told me to try the machine for a few days, I did, issue wasn’t fixed, called him back, he said he would look into it and call me back on Wednesday at 6PM GMT. No callback happened.

So this is where I am. Any advice from the community here? I just want a working MacBook free from

"Towards the end of 2013, my house was unfortunately broken in and had almost everything aside from furniture stolen from me in a single afternoon. One of those things that were taken was my 2010 top of the line 17” MacBook Pro with upgraded SSD, RAMs + all the bells and whistles. Thank goodness for insurance, but that laptop was the most devastating loss of all the items that I lost in the burglary as I had only backed up it 9 months prior due to my laziness. So 9 months of photos, videos, memories, intangible things that insurance cannot replace, were gone just like that.

For awhile, I periodically check iCloud to see if the MBP might turned up. I did set a automatic lock on it if it ever connects onlin. It never went online as far as I could tell. Years past and I gave up on every recovering it. 

Then, in 2015, I received a call from the local police station saying they picked up a ‘known-person-of-interest’ and on her was an iPad (that was also taken from my home). This iPad never had the Find My iPhone app set up, but it has engraved on the back, a name that does not match this person they picked up. Going through their records, the police matched the iPad’s engraving to my police incident report and promptly dropped it off at my place. I asked the police if the person they picked up could have anything to do with the burglary but they had no evidence that she was involved and thus did not/could not pursue the matter any further as she was picked up on unrelated incident.

While I was happy that I recovered my iPad, the data in it was already long deleted. I didn’t have any important stuff in it anyways so I wasn’t too disappointed that it was formatted. 

Fast forward into August 2016, while working on my iMac, I get a ping on my phone and alert on the computer at the same time, stating that the MacBook Pro has been located and locked.  I was confused. I had my MBP (current one) sitting right next to my iMac and why the hell would it be locked from iCloud? I went onto iCloud to see the location where it was pinged and to my surprise and realisation, it was showing a location about 10-20 kilometres away. It all clicked in my head within those nanoseconds. It was the bloody stolen MBP from years ago.

“Wtf” 

I contemplated on what to do next. ‘Go see the place myself?’ ‘Bring friends?’ ‘Call the non-emergency police line?’  I had to go through folders upon folders to find my police report number. Called up the non-emergency police and explain that the stolen laptop from 3 years ago turned up on Find My Mac app tonight. Got transferred twice to the appropriate department and the appropriate police station and each time I explained, the surprised reaction from the other end when they realised it was from 3 years ago was quite amusing. 

Within the hour of finding the MBP on iCloud’s radar, the police sent a car to the house location that I gave them and the policeman who was on location called me and said that they’ll try their best but also say that if the occupant denies them entry into the house, they will have no choice but to leave. I can only hope.

Minutes later, he called again and said he got the laptop and confirm the description matches my report from 3 years ago. At this point I was unreasonably ecstatic. He also said that they have no reason to believe that the person who had my laptop were involved in the burglary. My stolen MBP was apparently bought off from $500 from a group trying to pawn it off at a cash converter but couldn’t because of a huge deep scratch right down the middle of the screen. Buyer was there to witness it and got it from the group who obviously made up a story about why they were selling it. 

Days later, I received my laptop. Deep scratch from top to bottom in the middle of the screen, body was very roughed up, especially on a corner, like it was dropped heavily. I do remember seeing my broken gym bag strap on the floor of the day of the burglary, so I can only assume it was dumped into my gym bag and in the burglars' haste, the strap broke and dropped the laptop on the corner.

I spent days trying to unlock the laptop as I couldn’t remember the passcode that I used to set the automatic lock 3 frigging years ago. When I did get it unlocked on a fluke, my **goodness**, my account was still intact somehow with all the memories stored on it still there. It was such a huge relief to find stuff on it that I thought I lost.

I also brought into Apple Store to see if they could fix the screen (they could not), thankfully they still sell the charger for it. (it wasn't picked up by the police unfortunately, and I also forgot to mention it during the search)

Now I have a 6 year old laptop which I only got to use 3 years of it before it disappeared. 

I do have a couple of questions about this lost and found incident though. 

 1) I checked through the browser history and the MBP was definitely online (not on my account though) during the years that it was lost, why didn’t iCloud detect it until a few months ago?


2) Also, I don’t know what living condition the guy who bought it is in, but the MBP absolutely *stinks*. It doesn’t smell anything disgusting but the stench is very strong, sort of like having your coats dry cleaned kinda of smell. Just very pungent. How do I get rid of it? I have tried airing it (unscrewing the bottom panel), running the fans at high speed for hours, wiping it down several times…. nothing seem to diminish the smell. Any advice is much appreciated.

Big thanks to Western Australia Police (Mirrabooka branch) and Apple for the awesome Find My iPhone/Mac app. 

TL;DR Home broken in 3 years ago, lost precious laptop; 3 years later, iCloud picks it up on radar, Police happily retrieved it for me; Laptop now stinks, how to remove smell?

"I found this very suitable for the conditions apple currently in. E.g apple has alot of ads and advertising campaign and more iterative design. This the qoute from steve jobs:

“If you were a product person, you couldn’t change the course of that company very much,” Jobs said. “So who influenced the success of PepsiCo? The sales and marketing people—they were the ones that got promoted, they were the ones that ran the company. ”
Jobs then added: “It turns out the same thing can happen at technology companies that get monopolies. If you’re a product person at IBM or Xerox, so you make a better copier or a better computer, so what? When you have a monopoly market share, the company’s not any more successful.”

"Hey everyone,

I thought I'd give everyone an update on what came out of [my situation earlier this month](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/55as44/where_to_report_apple_store_experience/), when security personnel falsely accused me of shoplifting at the Santa Monica Apple Store.



First, I'd like to thank everyone who gave advice and support. I had no idea my post would have blown up like that; truthfully I thought I'd get a phone number or two, or an email address, and that would be that.


After receiving the direction you all provided, I did manage to speak with a case manager at Customer Relations with Apple corporate shortly after I posted here. She got on the ball immediately, took thorough notes about what happened, and promised to make this right.


However, it seems like even Customer Relations couldn't get the store to cooperate. After nearly 4 weeks of back and forth phone calls, the case manager informed me today that she had to close out my case. The best she could explain as far as a resolution was that the store promised that they were looking into the matter, but that's as much as she could do. 


I believe the Santa Monica store has no intention of resolving this matter. They swept me under the rug the first time, and every time the case manager tried to get us on a conference call, they were never available. 


If they hadn't lost my business already, they certainly have now, and I will be returning the case in question to the store tomorrow. I can't in good conscience let them keep the revenue that came from that incident.


Again, thank you to everyone who provided support and advice a few weeks ago.

"I'm seeing so many comments like ""Steve would never let this happen"" or ""Steve would be firing people left and right"" or ""Steve wouldn't let this product ship like this"" or ""Steve this"" and ""Steve that."" Enough already. Look... Steve was the heart and soul of Apple for as long as he was on its payroll. We know that. But while there were a great many things that came out of Apple on his watch, there were plenty of blunders too. He was a human being who had his own vision of what Apple should be and how their products should work, and not all of his decisions were the rose-(gold-)tinted decisions to which we're constantly comparing the modern Apple.

Tim Cook is not Steve Jobs. Jobs was a vision guy and Cook is a numbers guy. There's a fundamental difference in how they operate, so the notion that Cook makes decisions that Steve wouldn't make is *already clear*. But Tim Cook was chosen by Steve because they worked together, and in that decision he obviously felt that Cook was the best choice out of anyone else to steer the company after he checked out - *for better or for worse.* So what would Steve do if he were still alive? He would appoint Tim Cook as his successor. And that's exactly what happened. Leave it at that. 

Very few of you ever met the guy, even less (if any) ever worked with him. The simple fact of the matter is, you have **absolutely no idea** what Steve Jobs would do. The executive team at Apple worked directly with Steve Jobs for many years, and every single one of them is *infinitely* more qualified than any of us to make a judgement call on what he would or wouldn't do. And even then, before he died Steve specifically told Tim, *""never ask what I would do.""* 

We owe him that same respect.

"Edit: A lot of people are hating on eGPU. Let me paint a picture for you.

*You own a 13"" MBP. It's thin, light, and has great battery life. But unfortunately, it only has intel Iris graphics; great for day-to-day tasks, but not very good for Final Cut or gaming. You walk in the door and plug a single cable into your laptop. Suddenly, your ultra-portable computer has more GPU compute power than the $10,000 mac pro. For $300-$800, your now have a workstation capable of playing brand new games at ultra settings/100fps and rendering Final Cut movies more than* ***twenty times faster*** *than your laptop could while unplugged*.

The price for external TB3 GPU enclosures is rapidly falling (from $500) and can soon be had for [$300](https://www.akitio.com/expansion/node). It is easy to see the price falling below the $200 mark in the next 12 months.


For the uninitiated, this means you can buy a TB3-capable computer (such as the new Macbook Pros, Razer Blade, etc.), and for less than $500 have the GPU capabilities of a full blown desktop PC! Thin and light laptop on the go, to full blown gaming, **VR**, and rendering powerhouse when plugged in at home.


I really see this as the ultimate modern compute platform, [and Razer has really been leading the way.](http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-systems/razer-blade-stealth#ultrabook-desktop)

The beauty of this is that all we need to make this a reality in the Mac world is **proper drivers from Nvidia for their GPUs.**

"Hello All,

Many people ask me: ""I know Macs are safer than most PCs, but what extra steps can I take to ensure I am secure both online, and off?"". Throughout the years, in part thanks to some paranoia, I have collected a few practices that I think most people should follow. Also, being the holiday season, I'm assuming many people might have gotten new Macs, so this is a good time to go through this. It is my hope that by following some, or all of these points, you can feel a bit more safe while using your Mac!

**Important Note: NOTHING I post here is mine. This is all common knowledge/solutions that exist, I simply have compiled them into a list for convenience. I am in no way taking any credit for any of these practices, I am merely promoting their use. Additionally, if anyone else has anything to add, or change, please make yourself heard, I am not claiming to be a security expert, just someone who is aware!**

1. [Use 2 factor authentication](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204915). This one is a no-brainer, and one that I really hope everyone is already using! If you are heavily invested into the Apple ecosystem, as I am, the number one thing you don't want hacked is your Apple ID! It has credit cards, addresses, purchase history, everything on it! Make sure you utilize two-factor authentication to ensure that if someone hacks your iCloud password, they still can't access your account unless they have another trusted device of yours. This one alone can help immensely!

2. [Use a firmware password on your Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204455) This is another one that is a no-brainer to me. Basically, when you set up your Mac, you give it an account password to unlock the computer and get into your user account. What a firmware password does, is lock down the entire *operating system*, making it unable to boot until the firmware password is entered. This is crucial, because if your Mac is stolen, and you don't have a firmware password, they can simply boot into macOS recovery mode and reinstall macOS, essentially making it impossible for you to ever track your computer through Find my Device. **Important Note : make this password *different* than your normal user account password! Also, never forget this password, as doing so makes for a very, very tedious process requiring you to find your original proof-of-purchase (receipt) of the Mac and a service appointment at an Apple Store**.

 EDIT: Building on this point: /u/jmnugent added a great piece of advice: You can actually set a [custom Lock screen message](https://www.tekrevue.com/tip/mac-lock-screen-message/). This makes it so if your Mac is stolen or lost, can be returned to you (given you provide contact info). Additionally, if you have a firmware password, the thief wont be able to override this message, which is great because if they take it into a specialist to try to get it wiped, the specialist will see the lock message and pretty quickly be able to tell its stolen. 

3. [Make Sure Find my Mac is enabled at all times](https://www.apple.com/icloud/find-my-iphone.html) Im sure you all know what this is so I wont go into it as it is extremely self explanatory. However, with a Firmware Password, this is even more powerful, as you can lock it from iCloud.com, and then prevent your computer from ever booting while you track the thief.

4. Backups, Backups, Backups! In this online age less and less people are feeling the need to backup data. This is a terrible mindset. There are literally *tons* of methods to backup so I wont go to into depth. Personally, I do the following:
 1. [Automatically backup my Documents/Desktop to iCloud](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206985) Like most people, 95% of my data is stored within these two locations on my Mac. Having this on ensures that if my Mac crashes, I can always have a copy of my most important documents available. Extra iCloud storage is very cheap, I think I pay like 3/month for 200GB. There are also tons of other providers that can do this for you: Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Dropbox all have cloud storage that can be set up to automatically backup your most important files. 
 2. [Use Time Machine](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250) As extra redundancy, consider purchasing a extra hard drive you can use locally. This mirrors your entire Mac, so if it crashes, you can restore it exactly how it was. Hard Drives are *extremely* cheap nowadays, and you *don't* need to get an expensive one to do this!

5. Consider using a password manager. **It's a common misconception that hackers can 'hack' your password easily**. Most hackers have a database of commonly used passwords that they test against your account ([Most people have ridiculously stupid passwords](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/01/26/most-common-passwords-revealed---and-theyre-ridiculously-easy-to/)). Other methods for hackers involve brute forcing their way into guessing your password, which, if you have a semi-secure password, can literally take longer than the **life of the universe** to guess! With a single lowercase letter, a brute-force approach needs to guess 26 things, add in digits, it becomes 36 things, add in uppercase, the brute force now needs to guess 62 different options for just that single character. The takeaway is that a long-password with a mix of lower/uppercase letters and numbers is very, very difficult, if not impossible, to guess.

 Using a password manager helps you create complicated passwords like this, and there are many options. iCloud Keychain, if you are heavily invested into Apple/Safari use, 1Password, LastPass, Keeper Desktop, etc.

 EDIT: As some may have pointed out in the comments, try to *never* use the same password. I know this is tedious as hell, and can make for quite the headache, but it is more secure. Most people use the same password for everything. Many hackers, if they are able to hack into one of your accounts, may then try to apply that email & password combo to a host of other sites to see if they work. Don't let that happen!

6. **Keep your Mac up-to-date at all times.** As a university student, I shudder when I see somebody who has a relatively new Mac, and I see they are 1-2 macOS versions behind, or that they have ignored the ""Important Updates Waiting to be Installed"" notification for a year. I see this all the time. People, yes updates sometimes cause minor grievances, but they are literally released to help patch up security flaws. If Apple thinks the problem is worth fixing, they will send out an update. Listen to Apple and update!

7. [Use FileVault](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250) Not going to get into the technical bits of this, basically it encrypts your Macintosh HD using a industry-standard XTS-AES 128 bit encryption. Really good!

 As /u/DomPhotography pointed out below, make sure you also use this to encrypt any external drives that have your data on them (such as Time Machine external hardrives)

8. If you are not a very technical person, consider only allowing apps to be downloaded from the App store or identified developers. Most technical people I know can spot a malicious program from a mile away, but this is obviously not the case for everyone. Go to **Sys Prefs --> Security & privacy --> General** to see where Apps are allowed to be downloaded from. If you don't trust yourself, only download from the App Store! This isnt an insult at your intelligence, simply being vigilant. 

 Additionally, consider doing research on every program you download. It takes a few seconds to google the program name and you'll find out pretty quickly if its safe!

9. **Make sure you Firewall is on**. The standard fire wall that comes with macOS is great and catches just about anything. Make sure it is on, by going to Sys Prefs --> Security & privacy --> Firewall.  

10. **See which Apps have location services enabled** Do this by going to Sys Prefs --> Security & privacy --> Privacy. As a general rule of thumb, no app should be collecting location data unless you absolutely need it to, or if you use it for some sort of time/location based logic, such as f.lux. 

11. If you follow these general, practices, you **shouldn't need extra security software**. This is a **BIG** one. So many people download fraudulent ""Cleaning"" apps that are quite literally cancer for your Mac. Anything that claims to ""clean"" or ""secure"" your Mac, is probably fake(side note: Im working on making a list of apps that are definitely dangerous, AFAIK nobody has compiled a recent list like this) . If you *feel like you must* run extra software, get it from a reputable developer. Amongst these, [Norton Symantec](https://uk.norton.com/norton-security-for-one-device), [Bitdefender](http://www.bitdefender.com/solutions/antivirus-for-mac.html?clickid=3z40Rexnqx%3AgwY-1E0R2oTJpUkkXFX1FsSc2yU0&bdaffc=global&irgwc=1), and [Sophos](http://t.purch.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) are all great options. 

12. Watch out for Phishing. This one is **scary** nowadays. Developers make websites that look **exactly** like the real thing! Consider this recent case of how a developer made a login page that looked exactly like an Apple Site: [Link](http://lifeinlofi.com/2013/02/11/warning-apple-id-phishing-scam/). As a general rule of thumb, you can usually see if the website is legit or not by simply **observing the URL** before you click it. If it is something like **www.apple.com/login.php?** it is probably SAFE, but if it something like **www.apPle.hacje483.ch** it is definitely FAKE!. 

13. Whenever you visit a site that you enter your Credit Card into, **first check the URL bar**. If it starts with an 'https' then you should be safe (assuming the website is safe) to enter your credit cards the 'https' means that the communication is secure. If it simply says 'http' do not trust this website to reliably transport your credit card info!!

14. **Many people are paranoid about their webcams, and have them covered up with tape**. Let me first say, unless you are really stupid and got a terrible virus, **the little green light will always come on when your iSight is being used!**. However, if you are still paranoid, do the following:


 Spotlight Search ""Activity Monitor"" --> Click the ""CPU"" tab at the top --> Search for **""VDCAssistant""**. This is the process that uses the iSight camera. If its %CPU reads 0.0 percent, then it is not being used. 

15. Know your network. Any time you use your Mac in a public network, you put yourself at an elevated risk level. Of course, if you follow the previous 14 points i mentioned, this shouldn't be a problem, but it is important to know where you are, and who can see you from your network! 

 as /u/git pointed out int he comments, try to never connect to unsecure networks. These are the networks that do not require any password. When you connect o this, any and all of your traffic can be viewed.

16. **Never use an Admin account.** No offense, but most people aren't wise enough to be using an admin account. When you set up your Mac, make an admin account, and then make another user account that you will actually be using. You an check what type of account you have by going to :
Sys Prefs-> Users & groups and then observing what it says underneath the ""Current User"" Field. 

17. Never plug in a USB thumb drive unless you absolutely know what it is, or who it came from. USB drives can be loaded with executables that can carry out malicious tasks the second they are plugged in. If you find a USB stick, or SD card in the library, for example, **return** it or **leave** it, but do not plug it in!

18. Automatically update apps. Do this by going to Sys Prefs -> App Store and checking for automatic updates. Just like with updating macOS, updating apps can also alleviate many security issues. 

19. For the love-of-God, always require your password for purchases in the app store. You may not believe it, but some people actually keep this off because ""it takes a lot of time"" Well, I can guarantee it'll take even *more* time trying to recover a ~~stolen credit card~~ purchases made on your account that were not approved by you!

20. As my final point, I want to make it clear that solving security issues is a **team effort**. If you discover a flaw, or patch, or virus, or whatever, please *share it!*. Nobody will think you are annoying or over-paranoid, the more people we have contributing to cyber-security, the better we all are!



I'm sure I missed some points, but this post is already ridiculously long, and for that I apologize. 

I hope that by utilizing some, or all of these tactics you can feel more safe with your costly Mac. Again, I want to reiterate, if anyone has any additions, or edits, please let me know, I will make those changes as soon as possible.

I was uploading new revisions of my project to iCloud Drive and deleting them as I up newer ones, and eventually I got an error saying I had run out of space on iCloud. Each revision was about 5Gb and I had 30Gb to work with to start off with, so I know I wasn't accidentally filling up the drive. Eventually I had to wipe the entirety of iCloud Drive and put everything back on which brought me back to my original amount of free space.

I had a similar scenario with my iPhone too. iTunes was identifying a large chunk of my iPhone consumed storage as 'documents and data' yet there was nothing on the phone that could be consuming that much space. A call to Apple was unproductive - the support agent kept insisting that data did exist and was being occupied by my apps. There's no way that could have been the case though as I essentially deleted everything I didn't need and the combined storage consumption of my apps didn't add up high enough to what iOS was suggesting I was consuming. The only solution was the wipe the phone and start again.

I’m a tech savvy user, a programmer and sysadmin for 10 years, a person who likes video editing and photography. I was using Macs since 2009 when I bough my first 13” MBP. Then when it started being slow I’ve got well spect 15” 2011 with failing Radeon. After 3 years it died and Apple after few calls replaced it with brand new 15” MBP, which was Mid 2014 at the time.

Here’s the point: I’m a geek, I like new stuff and 2014 laptop started to be physically in pretty bad condition (since it’s my daily workhorse). I started looking over new offer and here’s a summary from my perspective:

  - USB C is great, so as my USB A. It’s reversible, but requires a whole new set of cables, which means for me:
    - DVI adapter
    - VGA adapter
    - At least two microUSB cables
    - At least single lightning cable
    - Ethernet adapter
    I can chew on that... but I wish there was USB > TB2 adapter with video support.
  - No models from current offer has HDMI. Just why? When I want to watch a movie with friends it’s convinient to just pull out my laptop and do so. It’s not like an Ethernet or DVD drive which rarely anyone use.
  - MagSafe was a great invention, too bad it’s gone now since it saved my computer more than few times.
  - The keyboard... I hope I’m not the only grumpy one who thinks its horrible with it’s very short key travel? 
  - TouchBar looks amazing, but how useful is it really? From my perspective I’m loosing F-keys used all the time in various IDEs and I have to look what am I pressing there. The worst part there’s no choice in 15” line.
  - I wish I can get more than 16GB of ram: it’s sill not possible due to battery limitations.

So really, can someone tell me how new MacBooks are really better than old ones? I know the CPU is better, the GPU is faster but really.... it’s 10 steps back and 2 forward :(

We've had a lot of internal frustrations lately, and now that Apple's major release season is over, we really wanted to have a discussion to get to the bottom of it.

The truth is, we (the mods) are tired. We’re tired of dealing with the trolls. We’re tired of dealing with the negative attitudes. We’re tired of dealing with the constant bickering, name-calling, childish behaviors, and incessant desire to complain about the same things over and over again. We’re watching this place slowly turn into something akin to the MacRumors forums, and that's something none of us want to see happen. We love this place, and we're very motivated to make sure it stays the #1 place to discuss Apple.

So without further ado, here are some issues we need to cover with you:

----

**The Elephant in the Room**  
There are a *lot* of negative attitudes in the subreddit. More than we've ever seen. The mod team is watching this place slowly devolve, and it's disheartening to say the least. Apple is a very polarizing company, and we should be able to both praise them and hold them to a high standard without turning on one another. We do understand Apple will get (and sometimes deserves) criticism. We just want it to be in a more constructive way so it isn’t just constant circlejerking, arguing, and complaining.

----

**We’re Motivated, but the Morale is Low**  
To be honest, we are getting exhausted by the work that the above elephant creates. Because of all the fighting, we’ve mostly taken a step back since it’s become a full-time job to deal with this problem. It’s harder than you might think because of all the unwritten rules we try to preserve – like leaving plenty of criticism because *we’re not* in the market of blindly defending Apple. But we're also not in the market of blindly attacking Apple. There's a balance that takes a lot of dedication to maintain.

Because we've been exhausted, response time by mods has been somewhat slow. So we want to sincerely apologize. We know it's been frustrating for some of you.

**But that changes today.** We’ve started disussing what needs to change around here in order to make /r/Apple enjoyable again. Here are some of the ideas which we’d like to trial:

----

**Trial 1: No Name-Calling**  
We want to do a trial of completely banishing name-calling and personal attacks in comments. Anyone who cannot keep it together and must resort to attacking someone’s character rather than their ideas will receive a 30-day ban. A second offense will result in a permanent ban without an opportunity to come back. Name-calling is childish, and it simply won't be tolerated here anymore.

----

**Trial 2: No Vapid Memes**  
We want to start removing comments with vapid memes and hivemind or copy/paste responses. The most recent example is one-/few-word replies with ""courage"" used like an argument. Another example is ""you're _____ it wrong"". They add nothing to the thread and just add work for us. We want to try removing them automatically to decrease workload.

----

**Trial 3: No More Beating the Dead Horse**  
This one is gonna be the most controversial, and that is why it’s a trial: we want to dramatically cut down on pointless negativity disguised as valid criticism. We feel strongly that comments shouldn’t devolve into echo chambers, and we want to cut off the head. That means we will remove the entire thread if that's what the conversation devolves into.

----

Please share what you think about these trials or if there is anything else you’d like us to try. We cannot promise a reply or a trial for everything, but we’ll read it all and take it into account.

We love you all, and we love this community. The whole reason we’re having this conversation is because we love this place. We just want to make sure everything we do is building towards our vision. And our vision is simple — **to have a place to discuss Apple passionately, both positively and negatively, in constructive ways.**

* Most people tend to be using Windows to demonstrate the build

I get that it's much easier to do external graphics on Windows because of the plethora of drivers but I have no interest in running Windows on my Macbook. That said, I assume in order to run an external GPU with OS X it is going to be from a fairly narrow list of compatible ones. Apple's website just lists AMD cards, not that I have anything wrong with that I've just seen some people running eGPUs with NVIDIA cards but it wasn't explicit if they only worked in Windows.

* Thunderbolt 3 step down to Thunderbolt 2

I've been looking at cases and there is a variety of different Thunderbolt 2 & 3 cases. While my Macbook has Thunderbolt 2 I was thinking that it would be wise to future proof a bit. As I intend to get a new Macbook in the next couple of years that will have Thunderbolt 3 I am wondering if it makes sense to get a Thunderbolt 3 case and use a 2 to 3 converter cable to hook it up to my Henge dock.

But, I didn't do use Siri because I also knew I would have to stop doing what I was doing, summon Siri, ask my question, deal with the fact that I can't do anything with the answer it gets back to me (because you can't copy and paste from Siri!), and then I'd have to switch apps back to whatever I was doing before. 

If I was actively typing something, I'd have to stop typing, reading stop reading, etc. - that's suboptimal.

Like I said in the title, I feel like Siri could be recast as the ""spirit of the iPhone (or whatever she is running on)"". So she could have control or awareness of of all non-windowed interfaces on the screen (and maybe some of the running apps too if devs allow API access and give good data). You should be able to say things like, ""set a timer in the top right corner of the screen for X time"". I don't want open the app for a timer, just show me that a goddamn timer has been set - I don't want to fucking see the countdown for fucks sake, I just want to know it will alert me at the end. Or I should be able to say ""add the opening paragraphs from the wikipage on San-Francisco to this doc"" while writing, or ask Siri to add the population of Papua New Guinea to the text I'm writing, or ask Siri to find a phone number and copy it to me clipboard... all without seeing the Siri app. 

It's just weird to me that Siri exists in this totally separate box, and that if I ask her for a timer I have to have her open up the whole Timer app - especially when this interruption is just to show me **numbers counting down**. I don't need to be interrupted from what I was doing to see this:

On my computer running macOS, I should be able to ask what color the VPN icon is to find out on my computer whether or not VPN connected - and I want her to understand the meaning (maybe this has to be added by the user, maybe by the dev) that the red icon means disconnected, and that's yellow is connecting, the names of the apps for every icon running run the menu bar, hiding and showing windows, controlling notifications, etc. She should be able to control the screen, the sound, outputs... It would be an easy way to add Siri interaction with apps that don't actually support it if you could ask things about how apps on the screen look.

Siri as an app made little sense, but it was what it was. Siri as OS layer, going forward, seems natural. 

I really hope that we find out soon that they have spent time allowing Siri to tie into the entire macOS and iOS API stack, and that it is all documented and ready for developers. I can envision how there could be some really cool things you could do with Siri if it worked in the same vein as the Automator / AppleScript (which might be getting deprecated).

I want to be able to say (or script): 

 > Siri, when I say ""am I connected to VPN"", look at the menu bar at the icon for the VPN software, and if it is **green** say **yes**, **red** say **no**, and **yellow** say **connecting**. 

You could theoretically do this whole script just with words and clicks on the screen in Mac OS - no actual scripting. And Siri on my phone should know what ""my computer"" is if both are signed into iCloud and I should be able to interact with things on my computer or phone from the other device. 

But everything is siloed and useless.

Edit: I just thought of another. It would be really great on iOS if I could ask Siri why a certain app failed, and she could even give me the option of sending it to devs if that information is available. There's no verbose error reporting on iOS - things just frustratingly fail. Would be nice if Siri could navigate the hidden filesystem and check an app's run logs.",2414.0,Why can't we interact with Siri on the phone without the UI taking over the screen?

It would be the 15 inches of the 2016 or 2017 but I also have the idea of the 2015inch as it is way cheaper and has  a more traditional design with it not having a touchbar and keyboard style. My main concern is it's future proofing when it comes to processor. I mainly intend to use with final cut and logic pro x.

I'm interested in buying a MacBook 15 inch. At first it was the 2016/2017 used I was looking at but I also just thought about the 2015 models. It has a different more traditional keyboard and also lacks the touchbar, but it has a bit of dated hardware. But it is also definitly more cheaper than the other models. I am wondering how future proof it would be compared to the other models. My main intentions are to use it for logic pro x and maybe light final cut pro and Photoshop. I am unsure which to buy in 2018 because also the new models will be coming in June but I am under the impression of it being more than 2k since that has been the average price for new macbooks and also it will have coffee lake processors. I am interested to try to keep my budget under 2k which is why I am looking at used ones.

"Last week I took my mid-2012 Retina MacBook Pro in for the ""service battery"" message. Going in, I knew this would cost about $200 and I would be out of a machine for a week or so. I wasn't too concerned and really just wanted the work done. Over the past 5 years, this machine has had the display replaced as well as the logic board. Neither have bothered me much since I was under Apple Care. 

During the Genius appointment, they let me know that the battery & top case was a ""constrained supply part"" and wouldn't be available until September. They offered to replace the battery for free if I waited. I mentioned how I use my machine for freelance work and how short the battery times have gotten. 

Surprisingly, the Genius said: ""hold on, we might have one more option"". He left for 5 minutes and came back offering to replace my current MacBook Pro with a refurbished model but, at the cost of the repair. He said that it would be the same specs as mine but refurbished. Everything was kind of cryptic. He wouldn't tell me which year the machine would be. I just assumed a later 2015 model or possibly early 2016 model. 

A week later, I'm opening a 15"" Touch Bar MacBook Pro! I'm really impressed at how far they went to keep me working. I even have the standard 1-year warranty with the option to purchase Apple Care again. Crazy to think I could not buy anther machine for at least a few years.

Coming from Windows as I have to have macOS device for work related reasons. I was hoping for some help on getting my music player situation setup.

Currently on W10 I use foobar2000 with a mix of mp3, flac, ogg, and whatnot... I'm very minimalist and simply sort based on artist or collab folders and then import those into f2k as playlists.

Basically, it looks like this: https://i.imgur.com/I8SEkSN.png I have around 90gb of music, so I like having it sorted this way (and it's how I've done it for the past 13 years or so :) )

All I really want is a media player that is minimalist, can play streamed content, can import playlists/folders easily, and has global hotkey support (hotkeys I specify, not F7/F8/F9). I really don't want something that's constantly reaching out to the internet to give me ""10000+ free radio stations!"" or an ""ad experience"", though if I need to buy the app that's fine so long as it does the job

I've done some research and I guess I need a 3rd party app to run scripts that enable global hotkeys like quicksilver? Or are there apps that have that built in? For those coming from f2k, what do you recommend I go with?

I was also looking at just getting WINE and installing f2k under that, but I'm sure global hotkeys will probably not work if I do that... :/ Am going to test sometime today.",11.0,Music player recommendations?,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/8chjwr/music_player_recommendations/,,,,

"""Team,

I know many of you share my disappointment with the White House’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement. I spoke with President Trump on Tuesday and tried to persuade him to keep the U.S. in the agreement. But it wasn’t enough. 

Climate change is real and we all share a responsibility to fight it. I want to reassure you that today’s developments will have no impact on Apple’s efforts to protect the environment. We power nearly all of our operations with renewable energy, which we believe is an example of something that’s good for our planet and makes good business sense as well. 

We will keep working toward the ambitious goals of a closed-loop supply chain, and to eventually stop mining new materials altogether. Of course, we’re going to keep working with our suppliers to help them do more to power their businesses with clean energy. And we will keep challenging ourselves to do even more. Knowing the good work that we and countless others around the world are doing, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about our planet’s future. 

Our mission has always been to leave the world better than we found it. We will never waver, because we know that future generations depend on us. 

Your work is as important today as it has ever been. Thank you for your commitment to making a difference every single day.

Ok so atm I have a base model Mac Mini 2014 but it’s getting slow with the 4gb of ram and old processor. I was thinking of selling that and getting the 2.5 GHz i5 or even the i7 second hand and putting more ram and an SSD in. Was wondering, is this viable nowadays and is it worth it? How much would I be looking to spend? Any help is greatly appreciated.

My computer is frighteningly new for how sluggish and lethargic Pages seems to be. It feels like an utter chore to use. I can type three to four sentences in advance of the text actually appearing on the screen. I've never experienced more consecutive rainbow wheels of doom. It's accidentally made me a better typist because I so dread making a mistake and having to backspace to correct it, because this too takes what feels like centuries when I'm trying to type fast and be productive. I've found a bandage solution in periodically saving my document manually with ?\-s, as it seems to prevent it from chugging along like an obese sixty\-year\-old, but it's still far from pleasant to use and way less than ideal.

I'm up\-to\-date running 10.13.4 and my machine is a late 2015, 27\-inch, Retina 5K iMac with a 4 GHz Intel Core i7, 32 GB 1867 MHz DDR3 for memory, and an AMD Radeon R9 M390 2048 MB

It seems pretty laughable to me that what looks on the surface to be a \(relatively\) future\-proof computer circa the end of 2015 two and a quarter years later has such issues trying to run its company's flagship word processor.

Any ideas?

"TLDR, got really sick, couldn't make it to my phone. Used Siri to call 911 on my iPad, which was right by my side. Paramedics came and hauled me off to the hospital. Thank God for Siri!

—————

Sunday night, I got really sick at 2am because of accidentally taking too much of my prescription drugs. I was lying in bed with my iPad next to me (playing Star Trek tng!) but my phone was across the room.
I woke up and had lost control of my legs, to the point where I couldn't walk. This feeling spread up my body, to the point where I lost the majority of control over my arms. Then my speech started to slur, and I was afraid my throat would close up.

I wanted to call 911, but there was no way I could make it over to my phone to so so. But my iPad was in reach, and while there was no way I had the dexterity to manipulate what was on the screen, I was able to mash down the button and say 'SIRI CALL 911'.

It took a few tries. One time, the phone rang, but it dropped when they answered. Calling back, it maybe took one or two tries to get Siri to understand. But on the third try the call went through and I was able to talk with the 911 people through the iPad.

It was only a couple minutes for the fire truck to get there. Really fast, they had me in the ambulance, and then to the emergency room. At the ER, they put some IV fluids in me to flush out the other stuff, and they kept an eye on me so things wouldn't go bad. The next morning, I was feeling much better and had checked out by 11am.

It was really a scary and crazy night. There was no way I could have reached my iPhone. I'm convinced that Siri saved my life. It enabled me to call 911, when I had no other way to do so.

So my lesson from this, next time I'm shaking my fist at Siri for mistranslations my commands, I will cut it a bit of slack because it helped me so much when I needed it.

Thank you Apple and the Siri team!
 
 
—————

Edit: a lot of people are calling out the fact that it took a couple tries, and Siri should have worked the first time. I think this wasn't all Siri's fault. First time, call went through and the phone rang, but the call got disconnected when they picked up, I don't know why. Second time I tried, but 911 was calling me back and my cell phone was ringing. For whatever reason this wasn't transferred to my iPad, probably because I was trying to talk to Siri at the time. After that, on my first or second try the call went through and I spoke to then through my iPad. 

So, took multiple tries partly because of Siri, partly because of Handoff, partly because the call dropped after it started ringing, partly because of crossed wires with an incoming call, and partly because of me slurring and fumbling.

"I bought the first iPad on release day in 2010, mostly because i thought it seemed cool, but I didn't really *need* it. Against my expectations it very quickly became my most used and beloved device, much to my surprise. As a result I ended up using it every day for hours at a time, largely because the form factor of having a touchscreen-enabled computer in the form-factor of a book turned out to be incredibly convenient and pleasurable. 

A few years later and my work paid for a top-of-the-line iPad, which turned out to be a 64GB iPad 3. Don't laugh though; this thing turned out to be an amazing machine that has fulfilled its purpose for five years with aplomb. Though I know it has the reputation of being the 'pretty crappy' iPad, this thing still did what I needed it to for all these years and the battery life is still good, lasting all day of constant use.  

So enters the new iPad Pro 10.5"", which I have been waiting for for a number of years. This thing is ridiculous. It's almost embarrassing. It's essentially the perfect distillation of what Steve Jobs and Apple have been visualising for however many years; a computer you hold in your hand and interact with without barriers. 

As I'm used to the speed, power and performance of the older device, every single thing about this machine is blowing my mind. The time it takes to open apps; the scrolling; the sound; the thinness and weight; Touch ID!; the form factor; the sheer quality of the screen.... 

Due to the 120Hz refresh rate and the larger display, it really does feel like I'm holding my apps and the internet in my hand and genuinely touching it with my fingers. It's difficult to describe, but it is a qualitatively different experience than using technology through a WIMPS paradigm on a traditional laptop/desktop. It's more intimate, immediate and rewarding and this iteration of the hardware only perfects the goals that Steve and Apple were trying to achieve with the iPad concept.  

To me, this is the perfect iPad, the perfect tablet and the perfect distillation of what technology can do in this space in this form factor. With iOS 11 we really have the next generation of mobile computing in our hands and Apple should be proud of what they've achieved.  

I know this post is long and seemingly sycophantic, but technology really can inspire when it gets it right, and the iPad Pro really, *really* gets it right. I actually feel like we've entered a new era of mobile and home computing with this device and I think that should be celebrated.",1961.0,The new iPad is absurd,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/6hicb6/the_new_ipad_is_absurd/,2017-06-16,"Just my two cents.

Let's go back to the point when Apple introduced the SE. Were they actually trying to make a smaller phones with basic features for lower price, or were they just making the best out of the frames that they already have for the previous two models (5 and 5S)?

In the first case, I'd say the new SE would still be a small phone, probably like an iPhone X mini? That would be cool.

But I'm afraid the reality is that Apple release the lower priced models only to make use of the previous models' externals. In this case, I would say the new SE, if it ever exists, will have the external of the 6 or 7, with the specs of the 8 or X or whatnot. It would still be cool if it's priced in the same range as the current SE, but not as cool as a smaller iPhone.

"Hi everyone, a few weeks ago, my app [Monochrome for Reddit](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/monochrome-for-reddit/id1128991367?ls=1&mt=8) launched on the App Store. It took about two years to build (LOTS of rewrites), and I had a blast making it. I'd like to share with you some of the cool features I’ve built. If one of the features I describe doesn’t quite make sense, or if you’re just more of a visual person, check out [this 3m video that shows Monochrome in action](https://vimeo.com/222034286).

Disclaimer: Some of the features I’m going to mention will be exclusive to Monochrome Pro, a $2.00 In-App Purchase. Monochrome Pro is the app’s only form of monetization. There are no advertisements.

* Stellar scrolling performance. Over the course of development, I’ve spent hours inside of the Time Profiler fine tuning performance. I think you will absolutely notice a difference in smoothness when using Monochrome. Every time I open another reddit app the number one thing I miss from Monochrome is the silky smooth scrolling.

* Dark mode and auto dark mode. Auto dark mode works by grabbing your location and calculating sunrise/sunset times. (Pro)

* Ever gotten lost as to who is replying to who? 3D Touch a comment to see its parent comment. (Pro)

* Monochrome has an intelligent system for analyzing URLs and determining what it should do next. The system only displays an SFSafariViewController as its last resort. If it has reason to believe the link is to a GIF, it will attempt to convert to MP4 and show that to you directly. Likewise if it believes it’s a link to an image, it will present the image directly to you with a native fullscreen image viewer. This extends to YouTube links, gfycat links, Imgur album links, and more. This system is employed everywhere throughout the app, meaning you get the benefits described here both when tapping a link in a comment and when viewing a post. Instead of going to a webpage to view content, this system skips the webpage and displays the content directly. Never see a banner again!

* Since GIFs almost always play as MP4’s, you will always see the version of the GIF with the highest resolution and FPS. If someone posts a 720p 60FPS GIF, you will a 720p 60FPS MP4. Unfortunately the official reddit app plays actual .GIF, so a lot of the time GIFs played by their app will look like slideshows and will play at much lower resolutions (see r/RocketLeague). Not to mention, playing .GIF is a lot more resource intensive because of the larger file sizes and significantly less optimized playback.

* When scrolling through posts, a GIF will only play once it is fully onscreen, similar to Facebook and Instagram. This is great because GIFs won’t start before you’re actually watching them.

* GIFs display a progress indicator in the upper left corner, letting you know how far you are through the GIF and how long the GIF is. This is very similar to the progress indicator displayed in apps like Snapchat and Instagram when viewing stories.

* GIFs maintain their progress between screens. This means that if you’re on the front page watching a lengthy GIF, you can tap to see the comments and maintain your place in the GIF. The video I mentioned at the beginning of the post shows this off nicely.

* Swipe left on a GIF to restart it.

* Select you’re favorite subreddits to be Quick Action subreddits. These subreddits will be accessible from Monochrome’s app icon via a 3D Touch. (Pro)

* Get notifications when you receive a post reply, comment reply, mention, or message. 3D Touch these notifications to quick reply, similar to how you’d reply to a text message.

* Intuitive messaging interface that looks almost identical to the stock Messages.app interface.

* Ability to delete conversations from your inbox.

* Swipe on a comment to collapse the comment tree. This feature is straight from Alien Blue. Easily one of my personal favorite features, something you get used to and then can’t live without. (Pro)

* Add multiple accounts and switch between them with a tap. (Multiple accounts is a Pro feature, single account is free)

* Watch the video I mentioned at the beginning of the post to get a better idea of how the following 3D Touch features work.

* 3D Touch a link to an Imgur album to see a natively rendered preview. Tap a link to an Imgur album to see the album natively presented.

* 3D Touch a YouTube link to watch the video in a natively rendered preview. If a timestamp is present in the YouTube link, the timestamp will be honored. The timestamp feature also supports multiple formats: t=12, t=12s, t=1m, t=1m12s. Also, the timestamp can be present as a parameter of the URL or as part of the URL’s fragment. Tapping a YouTube link will simply jump straight to fullscreen playback. Zero web content.

* 3D Touch a link to a GIF/image for a natively rendered preview. Tapping a link to a GIF functions just like tapping a YouTube link, immediate fullscreen playback. Tapping a link to an image presents a native fullscreen image viewer where you can pan the image and pinch to zoom.

* 3D Touch links to other things on reddit, such as subreddits, users, or posts, to see a natively rendered preview. Tapping links to other things on reddit simply navigates to them.

* 3D Touch links to articles to see a preview presented by an SFSafariViewController. Likewise, tap to simply see the SFSafariViewController fullscreen.

* Monochrome uses the standard iOS navigation paradigms and interface components. Since they’re developed by Apple, they’re polished and smooth.

* If you have an iPhone 7/7+, you will receive haptic feedback while interacting with various parts of Monochrome.

"Not sure how many people frequently use the digital touch heartbeat on their Apple Watch, but I wasn't one of them until a month ago. I bought my Apple Watch when it first came out, and my wife and I exchanged heartbeat messages maybe two or three times and then never used it again. Last month, my sister passed away from a rare form of cancer. While she was on her deathbed, my wife suggested taking her pulse with my Watch, just to see how she was doing internally. I gently rested the watch on her wrist, took the pulse, and, in the process, remembered the heartbeat feature. I sent her heartbeat to myself, so I could easily keep track of where it was. She passed away a few hours later. Today, whenever I need to feel as though she's with me, I just bring up that heartbeat and let it pulse. I wanted to share this with fellow Apple enthusiasts, as a use case I never thought about when I bought my watch, and one I hope you'll remember going forward if you're ever in a similar situation.

TL;DR my sister passed away and I use the digital touch heartbeat to keep her with me.

Edit: I had some people asking what kind of cancer (and others pointing out the potential to raise awareness), so I'll share it here. She had Small Cell Carcinoma of the Ovary Hypercalcemic. My family was told it affects 1% of women in the world, but I don't have the link to back that up.

However, when I use the laptop I generally have started to use the TouchBar more as there are quick ""shortcuts"" to functions that make it good to use.  For example after I write an email I can just tap the send icon to have it sent vs clicking.  Additionally, while Siri is very basic, if I wanted to use it I can just tap the Siri icon on the touch bar.

All of this is good, and I like some of the functions, however when I move to the docked setup I loose this functionality.  IMO if Apple would like to promote the TouchBar more it needs a keyboard with this built in.  Same goes for Siri.  I think they could keep the ESC key on the current keyboards and just replace the function layer with the OLED TouchBar.  I am not sure this would drive adoption to the masses, but for those of us that have started to try and use it it would be more consistant.  Plus, giving us a button to activate Siri would just be good future planning (I don't know why the eject button is still there).


Anyway, I am sure this has been looked at and maybe there is a technical reason why this would not work, but personally I would start using it more if it was always there.  That and if app designers would give us more control over what the TouchBar can do on a per app basis, sort of like customizing the menus.

**HOW TO UNLOCK YOUR DEVICE IF YOU GOT HIT TOO!**

----


Ok, There are a lot of comments and everyone that comes here with a similiar problem will not have time to get through them - so I'm adding a small section of how to deal with it if you got hit too.

First of all - **if you didn't have 2FA**, keep in mind that the person that accessed your account **had also access to the keychain with all your other passwords and all the photos and docs in the iCloud drive**. 


Secondly - as far as I understood from the comments, **if he set up a passcode on your phone (because you never had one), then you'll have to wipe your device anyways.**

So, the resolution - I assume your account was automatically on lockdown by apple, if not just skip the steps with password reset:

----

1 Open up https://www.icloud.com/#find

2 Log in

3 (Most likely) You'll be prompted to reset your password, you can do that here:
https://iforgot.apple.com/password/verify/appleid

4 Enter your email, the code from the image, then you'll be asked to answer a few questions and enter your 
backup phone number
5 Enter new password after going through the above step

6 Log in again to https://www.icloud.com/#find

7 Find your device on the list

8 Turn off the Lost mode

---

Then CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD AND NEVER REUSE PASSWORDS, Don't be a dumb ass like I was.

**tl;dr someone hacked into my two-factor protected account, put into lost mode, demanded 75$ or he'll wipe iCloud**

Yesterday when I was heading out to a party I noticed a strange message on my iPhone asking to send an email - and I suddenly realized that my phone was put into lost mode. 

http://imgur.com/a/IRSWO

I quickly jumped onto my inbox and found out that two devices were put into that state out of nowhere, and shortly after that Apple blocked my account (phew). To translate - Red arrows are the ""Device was put into lost mode / Device has been found"", Blue are ""Your account has been accessed from a web browser"", whilst the green one is ""Your apple ID password has been reset"". 

http://imgur.com/a/SFEcv

Yes, after I changed my password he was able to AGAIN change the lost mode status!

I mailed that account (obviously from a disposable email) to check what's going on, and I got an automatic response:

http://imgur.com/a/kXnqp

I don't hold anything in the iCloud thankfully (at least nothing important or shameful), so this doesn't really bothered me. But still, could anyone explain how the heck he was able to get around two factor auth?

Also, it seems no one paid yet, since the bitcoin wallet is empty

As for me, I've always had an Android phone (Galaxy S2, Nexus 4, Nexus 5, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Pixel XL, Pixel 2 XL) for all of my adult life. After going through some bad experiences with Android and/or Google in the past few weeks, I decided to buy an old iPhone 5S from a local Facebook sale group for $80.

My GOD I wasn't expecting it to be so good, especially for a phone that old. It still does exactly what I need it to do for me, mayyyybe besides Apple Pay. But other than that, holy shit! If I do not reddit too much, the battery easily lasts me an entire workday if not more. The phone's memory management is epic and I can have 30+ open apps (maybe they're hibernating?) and face no lags for any app other than Snapchat.

I have also updated the phone to 11.3 and haven't faced much difference with the speed/battery. The only thing I was worried about before the switch was the learning curve + having to live with ads (AdAway on Android after root is GOAT)... but the ads haven't been so bad either! They hardly ever hamper my phone usage even when (if) they show up!

I have been thinking a lot about privacy which spurred me to ask this question. (edit: I'm not trying to hide anything or think that Apple is being creepy, I'm just curious about the language change when I was researching Significant Locations).

Question: Are Frequent/Significant locations included in iCloud or iTunes Backup?

Previously, this was Apple's answer: 
For example, once you’ve opted into Location Services, iOS can remember your Frequent Locations and use them to provide commute information in Notification Center or automatic routing in CarPlay. It’s important to note that Frequent Locations remain on your device and are not sent to Apple, or even backed up in iTunes or iCloud. The one exception is if you opt in to improve Maps for yourself and other users, in which case we will occasionally collect your Frequent Locations but only retain this data in a purely anonymous form. Frequent Locations are encrypted with keys protected by your passcode on your device, and you always have the option to turn this feature off.

Now, this is what Apple says: 
Significant Locations — Your iPhone will keep track of places you have recently been, as well as how often and when you visited them, in order to learn places that are significant to you. This data is transmitted end-to-end encrypted between your iCloud connected devices and will not be shared without your consent. It will be used to provide you with personalized services, such as predictive traffic routing, and to build better Photos Memories.

I was confused, so I asked Apple Support if Significant locations were backed up in iCloud or iTunes and they said - yes, it's included in both backups and can be accessed through backups. The first paragraph said it stayed only on device. When did this change? 

Thanks!

"Updating macOS through the App Store can take a very long time — for me it's typically around 30 mins of rebooting and waiting.

macOS has a built in `softwareupdate` utility, which is much faster. It also allows you to use your Mac while it updates (the updates seem to be applied while it's powered on, and the reboot takes much less time than if it's triggered by an App Store update).

To use it, open Terminal and run one of the following commands:

*Note: `sudo` does not seem to be required*

`softwareupdate -l` to list available updates

`softwareupdate -i <name of update from the above command>` to install one specific update

`softwareupdate -i -a` to install all available updates

I usually do `softwareupdate -l` to check for updates and `softwareupdate -ia` to install them.

Before I started working here, they did a deployment of iPod Touch based scanners, similar to the ones that Apple uses in their stores for payments, etc. All 200 of them were setup on the same Apple ID and password. And for the life of me I have NO FREAKING IDEA WHY they provided the Apple ID password to the end users. Someone then enabled Two Factor Authentication with a phone number no one knows, effectively locking everyone out! So many of these users had retried logging in that now the Apple ID is locked. 

I have tried so many things trying to get this fixed. I totally understand security needs and ultimately my company will need to own up and learn from their mistakes. In the meantime, I still have a ton of devices that are useless.

I have tried to reset the Apple ID password, but at every turn, Apple is requesting the phone number of the trusted device. I have access to the devices currently signed in with that Apple ID, but because the Apple ID is locked, it keeps asking to unlock the account using the trusted phone number. It seems at every step of the way, that trusted phone number is at the heart of my problem. 

I called Apple and they basically said tough luck. Is there any recourse?

I have had the iPhone 8 for two weeks now and its a nice phone. Definitely much better constructed, but I can't use it as my main device, luckily an iPhone is worth more than a pixel 2 and well be a lot easier to sell that's for sure.

Some pros and cons :

pros: 
-build-Its well constructed and feels premium(although this doesnt matter to much to me because I use a leather or plastic case anyways)

-iOS 11.3-its smooth and stable but I wouldn't say it's drastically better than Oreo 8.1 (a lot of apple people here have this misconception that android is still like it was before ice cream sand which)

-Apps are well optimized, my local credit unions iOS app is way better than androids 

-imessage-is nice but irrelavent to me because I use Google voice, much better integration with pc and phone. 

-speaking of Google, the Google apps just feel better in iOS I don't even have any specific problem to point out. They just feel better so take that for what it's worth. 

-Apollo- best Reddit available it's seriously awesome wish android had it. 

-apple store-i feel if anything happened to my phone I am backed by a company that cares. 

-games-having the fastest processor on a phone does have its perks and that's games. They are smooth and start fast. 


Cons: 
-Notifications- they are trash as can be. Seriously its beyond me how this is still a problem. Especially when I get phone call, does it really have to take the whole screen? It's infuriating especially when I don't want to acknowledge the call. Pro tip I just realized you could use 3d touch and press the ""clear"" button and a clear all notifications will come up (how was I suppose to know this?). 

-Animations-Not the greatest and actually make the phone feel slower in comparison to the pixel 2. I remember when I had my iPod touch and thought the animations were amazing and futuristic, now they seem slow and almost clunky lol. I know I'm not the only one who feels this way. 

-Siri-useless that's all that needs to be said for that. 

-Default apps- not as bad as the last time I tried iOS but definitely not as integrated as android has it. 

-Music player-i mostly use online streaming for music but I do load mp3s still and the music player is so badly designed. I miss the sleek black look it used to have. On android I would use PowerAmp, the best local music player there is. So having to go to apples idea of a music player was a bad experience, and its a shame I liked the old one. 

-Ports-Ive accepted the headphone jack is dying but that does not excuse the lightning port. It is cool and all but Apple could have went with the standard USB C and been fine. Definite money grab for licensing seriously annoying. 

-Typing- this is purely subjective but I have found iOS to be worse at typing than android overall. I tried stock, SwiftKey, Fleksy, and for some reason autocorrect just isn't as good. A few other people I've talked to and seen on the Internet have also noticed this, so I know I'm not just crazy, on android I was able to use Fleksy and type without looking. 

-Camera-again subjective but overall I find the pixel 2 camera to be better and it even offers more features. Portrait mode actually works good on the pixel 2 not just a gimmick like many people here think. Photosphere is also not available on stock camera, I didn't use it much but there was a few times I used it and loaded up the images in daydream vr which I also gave away during the trade. 

-File Management- damn this was disappointing having to download iTunes in order to copy over what I wanted. It wasnt as bad because I do have a plex server, but when I took a long road trip this last weekend I didn't always have service. I only had iTunes on my desktop and not on my laptop and didn't have a way to download iTunes when I was out on the road. So that meant I couldn't transfer all the media I had on my laptop to my phone. 

-Torrents- I know this is a sketchy subject for a lot of people here, but the fact I couldn't do it anymore sucked. I went through the process and got my vpn connected on the iPhone but couldn't download my torrents so what was the point lol. 

-Emulators- When I'm on the go I always have my laptop and Xbox controller with me. The new Xbox controllers use Bluetooth so I am able to natively connect it to my android phone or laptop, but not with this phone. I installed tweak box and seen there are some great emulators that actually run really great(they better on the fastest processor on a smartphone) but useless without being able to use physical buttons. I know there iOS controllers, but just that lack of compatibility means I would have to carry more stuff. 

-Customizability- of course this would be on here. On pixel 2 I used nova launcher with my specific set up of where and how many icons were on my homescreen. My specific icon pack that I liked, and my specific gestures to open apps. None of that here on iOS for better or for worse. 

-hackability-this is kind of a made up section but here are a few examples. I set up tasker to automatically open Spotify when my Bluetooth headphones connect. A little thing but awesome time saving things like that are what made tasker so nice to have. Being able to bypass my 600kb hotspot throttle was nice too, but only available here with a jailbreak that does not exist on iOS 11.3.

I know I didn't put a lot of pros and that's not a bad thing. It's because the iphone is good at just being a phone and doing what we expect from phones these days. It just doesn't offer me the customizations that I expect from a phone and I know I'm in the minority when using my phone the way I do, but still I believe Apple is going to have to add some customization soon. Consumers are getting more and more tech savvy believe it or not.

When I had an issue with my iPad two years ago I got a replacement within 24h. This was great but this kind of instant solution would be so much more improtant for Macs, that people or at least I rely on for work. With the iPad I gladly would have waited a week or two and watched Netflix on some other device but my MB isnt that dispensable. I understand that macs are repaired and iPads or phones often just replaced but right know I feel let down. I certainly didn’t expect to walk out of the store with a new device but either a much faster, preferably overnight service or some kind of rental offer as with broken down cars for such long repair time would have strengthen my customer loyalty instead of putting me into such a tight spot.

This was great but this kind of instant solution would be so much more improtant for Macs, that people or at least I rely on for work. With the iPad I gladly would have waited a week or two and watched Netflix on some other device but my MB isnt that dispensable. I understand that macs are repaired and iPads or phones often just replaced but right know I feel let down. I certainly didn’t expect to walk out of the store with a new device but either a much faster, preferably overnight service or some kind of rental offer as with broken down cars for such long repair time would have strengthen my customer loyalty instead of putting me into such a tight spot.

You're probably wondering why I'm posting this here. The reason is because Apple worked with the company that I bought my hearing aids from (GN Hearing, Resound) and they are labeled as ""Made for iPhone""

What that means is that my iPhone sees the hearing aids as hearing aids and I can control them directly from iOS. A quick triple tap of the home button lets me adjust the volume or change the settings, all without going into the manufacturer's app. 

Because I'm getting used to them still, I'm constantly adjusting the settings, and this has made the transition painless and almost enjoyable. I can even use the iPhone as a microphone for my hearing aids, so I can place the iPhone somewhere and it can send sound directly to my hearing aids if I want. I can even stream music or sound from the iPhone directly to my hearing aids as if I was wearing headphones, and it all happens automatically.

But lately I’ve been trying out my iPad Air 2 with a Bluetooth keyboard folio case and so far I have been able to do 99% of what i do at work all on the iPad with ease except ONE crucial thing. And that is to connect to a printer/Xerox  via USB and print documents.

My workplace has a big Lanier xerox machine on each floor very often i have to print copies of materials for students for tutoring and aftershoool stuff. I usually just plug in my MacBook to print via usb because to print on the network you need to print from a school computer terminal on each floor so i would have to transfer the file on a thumb drive from my MacBook to the terminal and print from there the whole thing is really a hassle so i just plug my macbook into the printer via usb and print.

Is there ANY WAY to do this with an iPad? Even if its some expensive app or expensive dongle or device i have to buy. I really have come to love using the iPad at work this past week and this is the final thing that is keeping me from using iPad as daily driver at work is usb printing. Any ideas?

"Just wanted to throw out a friendly reminder. There is absolutely no way Apple is going to be able to live up to the hype that has been created over the last 2 years of rumors for this new iPhone. 

The important thing to remember is that they hype didn't come from Apple. Apple hasn't made any promises. If the phone has TouchID and no FaceID, it's not Apple's fault that we are expecting that. If the phone has a 2 inch bezel on the top and bottom and a 6 inch bezel on each side, just remember that Apple didn't hype a bezel-less phone. 

No matter what they announce, some leaks will be true and many won't. The ones that you were excited about that don't come true aren't Apple's fault. 

Just try to enjoy the moment and give the device a chance before you slam it. Like, put your hands on it before you declare it to be unholdable. Use FaceID before you declare it to be stupid. Give the new power button a chance before you declare it too large. 

Then, once we get our hands on them, we can tell everyone how stupid they are and how backwards Apple is and how Steve Jobs would never let a product like that ship.

I think there's a good chance it's going to be a Note-like device with Pencil support and a ProMotion display.

The lack of 3D Touch makes sense because it would be confusing to have pressure sensitivity in the display and the Pencil. And an LCD is needed for ProMotion.

Obviously, it won't be the most popular iPhone because most people won't need the Pencil support. But I think there are enough people out there who would like to take notes and draw on an iPhone with the Pencil to make it successful.

If it really does start at $550, it could be aimed at students.

Siri used to be absolutely useless to me (music wise) because it'd always want to play something on apple music and I'm not a subscriber so  I never had music loaded on my phone besides a few free tracks I bought on iTunes.

I learnt of the tip that if you add ""in the library"" to your request, then Siri *would* actually play music that's on the device.  So I go and use itunes to load some recently added music to the phone.  These are tracks that I've made sure all have metadata and mp3tags.   I actually have a pretty large iTunes library to pull from.

So the first couple of days, everything worked great.

* Siri: I couldnt' find 'chillhop records' in your music

* me: ""play artist chillhop records in library""

* siri: I couldnt' find ""chillhop records in library"" in your music

* me: (getting frustrated) ""Hey Siri Play some FUCKING music""

* siri: ""playing chillhop records essentials 2016""

I'm bewildered at this point that that command *actually* worked.  The track that's playing however I don't really like so I say:

* ""hey siri skip to next track""

and the song just starts over again.  WTF?

* ""hey siri skip to next track""

and the song starts over AGAIN..  I think Siri is restarting the track but no.  Siri decided to make a playlist consisting of 1 single track on an album and it's just repeating.

At that point, I'm about to lose it....  and I finally realize how much of a piece of shit Siri is.  

The thing is, I'm perfectly fine with Siri having reduced functionality.  I lived with Siri not playing music for the longest time (I used Plex to stream music from my library).  But it's the ***inconsistency*** that's driving me up the wall.

There should be NO reason why a command as simple as ""Play XYZ in Library"" should work one day but not another day.   And don't get me started on the fact I *have* to specify ""in the library"".  that already is stupid.

Upon boot, it booted ""differently"" than normal. Instead of being in the 1:1 pixel mode (extended desktop or whatever it's called) like I like, it was in the default resolution. Odd.

Then, upon attempting to log in, my password was not accepted. Tried multiple times, made sure caps lock was off ... nothing. Password hint is the same as always. 

So I restart and try to boot in single user mode to run a check on the drive. Can not boot in single user mode. 

After some tinkering, it looks like my volume is locked with FileVault. So I try and unlock. Password is also not accepted (different one). 

Try and reset thing with my Apple ID, it's unsuccessful.

We immediately signed into iCloud to track it. It showed us where it last was, but it wasn't there.

We set it up to flash a friendly message on the screen whenever someone turned it on, and supplied my personal phone number for someone to contact us.

Days past and nothing happened. iCloud kept saying the phone was at the same spot.

Last week (now April, 2018), someone from Kingston, PA called my number and said ""I found your girlfriend's iPhone in my desk at work after being away for a week and there's a message on the screen to call you.""

We were so thankful! The finder even said she was going to be near my middle-of-nowhere town in PA this week and she could drop it off anywhere I'd like. It was a wild coincidence that I'm from middle-of-nowhere PA, lost the phone in VA, and now the phone is in someone's hands, not far from middle-of-nowhere PA.

 Since then, she has become unresponsive and then today she told me ""whoever left the phone at her cubical has taken it back"".

It's a fishy situation, and I'm still trying to figure it out. But...

My question is...if the phone was turned on and the message flashed, why is the phone not being tracked by iCloud anymore? 

Clearly somebody has been charging it and attempting to use it if it's been gone for 7 months and the message is still being seen. Someone is actively carrying this thing around and keeping it on. 

It was lost in Virginia and the person who has it now is in Pennsylvania. 

Why is iCloud not registering a location? I thought maybe it's because the SIM was removed, but this phone doesn't have a SIM to begin with.

"The versions of iOS have always been fine for me in the past, just with minor bugs. iOS 11 is by FAR the worst upgrade for me, here's my experiences:

- Huge increase in the rate of apps and the whole OS freezing. This used to happen very occasionally on iOS 10 but now it’s happening several times a day and is incredible irritating, especially when I need to just quickly check my phone for something and it ends up taking maybe 5 minutes instead of 5 seconds by the time my phone reboots etc.
- Volume controls don’t work. Sometime they do, but usually not. This is both for the buttons and headphone controls. I am currently getting around this by using the control centre. However, I can’t change the ringer volume this way so I have no way other than going into the settings every time I want to adjust that.
- When I have music playing on Spotify, on the control centre it still shows controls for the ‘music’ app. This, combined with the headphone controls not working, means the only way I can pause/skip etc is to go into the actual app each time. 
- Huge delays when I press buttons. For example ocassionally when I press pause or control the volume from my headphones it will decide to work, but only do what I wanted after a huge delay. 
- After turning airplane mode on then back off, Bluetooth is now even if it wasn’t before I turned airplane mode on. But I understand this could be intentional? 


I really hope apple will fix these bugs asap. I've experienced many others but these are just the ones most annoying.

"I've spent the last couple of days thinking about whether I should write something up for this sub. I was slightly concerned that it might come off a little self-congratulatory, but I figured some of you would get a kick out of it so here we are. To be honest, I'm not sure exactly which details you'll find interesting, so I'll just tell the story and feel free to ask me any questions.

For a little background, this was my first week doing a DPhil (PhD) in Engineering Science at Oxford after having finished my undergrad degree in the same department this summer. My masters project was titled ""Exploring Indoor Environments for Augmented Reality"" and my DPhil is now in Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM). SLAM is a cornerstone technology for AR and so I have very much stayed in the same field.

Anyway, you may have seen the videos of Tim Cook visiting Oxford for the opening of the Oxford Foundry this week. Since Tim is massively into AR at the moment, my supervisor and I were asked to put on a little demo at the event for him to show some of the stuff being worked on at the university.

I was obviously slightly nervous, but I assumed that there would be plenty of demos and he would only spend a passing moment looking at what we had been working on. When we arrived at the event however, it turned out that we were the only two demoing for the post-talk, VIP-only drinks and canapés. I was bricking it.

This meant that I got to have a pretty much one-on-one conversation with Tim for about 15 minutes, talking about my work, AR in general etc. (with his PA asking him to wrap up the whole time haha)

I don't remember everything we talked about but I can tell you about some of the things that stuck out:

- I was incredibly surprised about the obvious knowledge Tim had about the topic. I had expected to be asked high-level questions about what we were doing, but Tim was asking down to the gritty detail about everything (such as how the particular depth camera we were using worked).

- He is just as calm and well mannered as you would expect from seeing him in interviews and on camera. He made an effort to be engaged about what you were talking about and to show that he was listening to what you had to say.

- He was quite playful and funny. There was a thank you speech to all the donors which was taking far too long, but he slowly crept across the room to our demo during the speech and was even whispering a few jokes while it was still going on.

This was honestly one of the most amazing experiences of my life. I only currently have a selfie (https://imgur.com/a/ekVFT) to prove it, but I am hoping I can get the pictures from the event photographer because I saw him taking quite a few in the corner of my eye.

"I’m curious as to how often you guys experience these bugs because they are honestly infuriating and remind me of having an android. 

First annoying bug which happens way too often, when i answer a phone call, i cannot head the other person and they can not hear me. When this bug starts happening, it doesn’t fix until i reset my phone. another part of this bug is whenever i try to make a phone call, it will not ring. and when i try to adjust the volume on the phone call the volume slider does not show up. very annoying especially since i can’t just try making the phone call again, i have to restart 

another very annoying bug is, half the time, more often than not actually, the music won’t show up on the lock screen, preventing me from changing the volume anywhere outside of the actual app playing the media, wether it be the podcast app, soundcloud, spotify, etc. this one sometimes fixes without me resetting my phone but i usually have to reset for this to fix 

the last most universal bug is my phone will freeze up like crazy so many times through out the day, for a couple minutes at a time and seemingly randomly. very annoying. 

how common are all three of these issues for anyone else? the freezing one i guess i can kind of forgive but the other two drive me absolutely crazy, especially considering i have an iphone 7 plus

"Hey!

For the last almost three years, I've been developing a brand new Reddit app for iOS called Apollo. I used to work at Apple, and since then I took what I learned and built Apollo from the ground up to look and feel like a gorgeous Reddit experience that is distinctly iOS, following the design guidelines Apple put forth, to almost envision what Reddit would look like if Apple themselves built a Reddit app, with all the power, speed and flexibility you could possibly want.

**Download link:** https://itunes.apple.com/app/apollo-reddit-client/id979274575?mt=8

**Trailer:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKbPZVDg-Z8

I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/2u86mj/announcing_apollo_a_brand_new_gorgeous_reddit_app/) a few years back, and literally thousands of awesome Redditors joined the beta program to help sculpt the best Reddit experience possible and form Apollo into what it is today. So much of the feedback fundamentally transformed Apollo beyond what I could have done or foreseen myself.

It's available for download for free, and I'd love for you all to check it out if you have the chance (and send me feedback over in r/ApolloApp if you have any!). Fundamentally, I focused on giving it a gorgeous iOS design, with a really powerful Media Viewer, incredible comments experince, a full Markdown editor, fully customizable gestures, and so much more. It's insanely powerful, while also maintaining a really clean, simple design.

Again, your feedback would be monumental. This is just the beginning for Apollo, and really hope I can keep building onto it for a long time coming with even more incredible features.

### Questions

##### Why build it? There's already Reddit apps.
While there are some nice ones, nothing exactly scratched my itch as to what a Reddit client could really achieve on iOS. Alien Blue came close, but still had a UI that especially once iOS 7 launched felt outdated and somewhat out of place on iOS. Android also has some really great clients, but I just think the experience on iOS has been lacking and is due for something to really show what Reddit on iOS can be. I built Apollo with the goal of not just being the best Reddit experience on iOS, but the best Reddit experience *period*.

##### What's wrong with the official Reddit app?
Nothing, if you're happy, great! Reddit has a lot of really smart people on it. For me, however, I'm not a fan of how they're trying to get one central look across iOS and Android, I really think an iOS app should look and feel like an iOS app, and an Android app should respect Material Design. I think designing for the middle results in a clunky experience where the potential of both platforms is never realized to the fullest. Apollo is an iOS app period, built to take advantage of iOS features and feel like a beautiful, familiar iOS app. I also think they discontinued Alien Blue without incorporating the best parts of it that people loved the most, such as the minimal, uncluttered UI (Alien Blue was much more compact and concise), as well as powerful features like swipe to collapse comments, full screen, inline previews for links in comments, etc. Apollo has all that and more, because I think it's essential part of browsing on iOS.

##### I'm still using Alien Blue, why use Apollo?
I can say without question Alien Blue was an incredible app, I loved it. But it's very clearly not being taken care of anymore. If you plan to get an iPhone X, it won't even display properly and will have black bars at the top. For everyone else, it's simply not getting updates or being maintained properly, and it's obviously got worse and worse. Imgur links don't work that well anymore, Reddit's own content links certainly don't, more and more things are stopping loading. Lots of new features of Reddit are missing (and even some old goodies, like multireddits) too. I really built Apollo with the power of Alien Blue in mind, I think if you're a fan of Alien Blue you'll feel right at home in Apollo.

##### It's free? How do you make money/expect it to survive?
I more or less just copied how Alien Blue did it, where it's free to download and use forever (with no ads), and you can unlock a ""Pro"" version in the app for $2.99 that unlocks some extra features like submitting posts (same as Alien Blue did), automatic dark mode, customizing gestures, customizing the app icon, and a bunch more. I mean, I'd love to give out everything for free, but I can't afford to compete with a billion dollar company like Reddit. I'm just one guy in an apartment with an awesome girlfriend and [two cute cats](https://i.imgur.com/7dKJs2n.jpg), and obviously need some form of revenue in the app to sustain me being able to build the app at all and give it a healthy future. Choosing *which* features to include in Pro is obviously hard, but I thought Alien Blue [set a good standard](https://www.reddit.com/r/AlienBlue/comments/1i2fe4/im_trying_to_convince_a_friend_to_get_pro/) with its unlockable features, which allowed it to have a healthy, long-ish life. I hope that's understandable, I just really want to be able to keep building onto this app for a long time coming.

##### Does it have ads?
No, no ads anywhere.

##### iPad app?
Yep, it's a universal app! I have awesome plans to really bring it further and to the next level on iPads as well.

##### Available everywhere?
Yes! International, baby!

##### What are your plans for Apollo for the future?
A lot. :) I have a ton of things I want to build for Apollo, from an even better, super-powered iPad app, to even more powerful content filtering, more moderator features, full comment search, etc. My plan is to have users vote on which features they want to see the most, and I'll work on those, so it'll become even more of a Reddit app for Redditors, by Redditors.

If you have any more I'm more than happy to answer them! I'll be at my keyboard all day until I've answered everything or my wrists fall off. EDIT: Oh boy, you all are hard to keep up with. I will answer every question though if it takes me weeks!

"As with the iPhone 7 and 8, Apple has two different SKUs of the iPhone X, A1865 for Qualcomm and A1901 for Intel. While the press has mostly focused on theoretical speed differences between the two, let's instead look at potential real world differences. Before we get there, some background:

Apple while an innovator when it comes to SoC, camera design, supply chain, vertical integration, and smartphones in general, has been extremely conservative with regards to the cellular/RF side of the house. Apple has typically used a 1-1.5 generation old (when compared with Android devices) RF stack, whether it's for design, price or other reasons. As a result Apple has been late to the game or still hasn't enabled technologies like 3G, LTE, VoLTE, Wifi calling, EVS, HPUE, LTE-A, LTE-U/LAA, advanced antenna designs enabling 4x4 MIMO, etc.

So why this matter?

While the press talks about *omgz Gigabit LTE is so much faster than 450Mbps LTE*, which no one will hit in real life, nor do the vast majority of carriers have enough spectrum to achieve this, what the press isn't talking about, and what people actually care about is **battery life**. After the display, the two biggest consumers of battery are the SoC and the radios (modem, transceiver, power amplifiers). So what will the difference be between the two models?

iPhone X - A1865:

* Qualcomm X16
* 14nm Samsung FinFET 

iPhone X - A1901

* Intel XMM 7480
* 28nm (TSMC?)

As you can see, when it comes to the process, the Intel modem is 1.5 nodes behind the Qualcomm modem. A very conservative estimate would be just from the process itself, the Qualcomm modem will be at least 30% more power efficient. There's very little public information available on the transceivers, but given that the Intel PMB757 has the exact same dimensions and a mostly identical die, to the previous generation transceiver used in the iPhone 7, I would once again expect Qualcomm's WTR5975 to have a large battery consumption advantage. 

A second, potential issue, that will affect battery life is cell edge performance. As [Cellular Insights] (http://cellularinsights.com/iphone7/) excellently reported, there was a relatively big performance delta between the Qualcomm and Intel iPhone 7 models at the cell edge. There were many anecdotal reports that the Intel iPhone 7 didn't maintain a connection where the Qualcomm model did as well. Skeptics dismissed the report and complaints saying that in the real world, a 10-30Mbps difference isn't noticeable. Before we go into that, once again, some background:

Phone radios use drastically different amounts of energy depending on what they're doing. For the vast majority of the time, your phone is in standby, sitting in your pocket, or on your desk, with the screen off. During this time, your phone's radio is in an idle state, camping on a nearby cell. When someone calls, a message is pushed to your phone, or you turn it on and start checking your email, your phone's radio is suddenly pushed into an activated state, and is using up to 100x the power compared to when it was idle. As a result of this difference, the phone's radio resource management software is always trying to idle as long as possible, and when active, transmit data as quickly as possible so it can complete it's task and go back to idling, just like a CPU. Now let's take the following scenario:

You're somewhere with weak signal, and you pull out your phone to check the score of the game and watch some highlights: 

* With a good RF stack, despite the weak signal, you connect, download the data somewhat quickly, view the score, watch the highlights, press the power button, and the screen turns off and your phone goes back to idle. 
* With a weak RF stack, you connect, but the data takes a much longer time to download. Not only is your radio in a high power state for longer to download the same amount of data, you're also sitting around waiting, staring at your screen which has to be on longer as well (which is the biggest power suck of all). In an extreme case, your phone may not be able to maintain its connection with its current cell, which triggers a search for other cells to connect to, which one of the most power intensive things your radio can do

Since Intel essentially has no other design wins other than the iPhone, we won't know how much of an issue this is until Cellular Insights or someone else does the same test with the 7480 vs the 7360. Hopefully there's been some improvement between generations but I'm personally not optimistic given the multi-generation lead Qualcomm has. 

**So what this does all mean?**

* It's extremely likely, the Qualcomm iPhone X will have better battery life than the Intel version
* What's the actual difference between the two?
* The above is the million dollar question. Due to the nature of the real world, and real networks, this is something almost impossible to independently test without tens of thousands (hundreds of thousands?) of dollars of equipment. With the demise of Anandtech, in general tech reporting as gone down hill, and I don't foresee anyone being able to do this type of rigorous, controlled testing. 
* To compound this, if I was a betting man, I would guess that Apple only sends out the Qualcomm version (ostensibly for network compatibility) to reviewers
* My personal guess is that in the real world, there might be a difference of at least a few percent of battery life, potentially more depending on your usage of LTE vs. Wifi, if you're indoor vs outdoor, etc.

**So why does Apple do this?**

* The Intel RF stack is likely $5-7 dollars cheaper per device than the Qualcomm equivalent which is huge when you look at the overall BOM
* Modems are critical, complex, and difficult to engineer. Even Intel with all of its expertise, and resources, is still licensing DSP IP from Ceva for their basebands. Just as Apple is supporting LG to prevent a Samsung monopoly in the OLED space, Apple is supporting Intel (until they do it themselves...) to prevent a Qualcomm monopoly. Unfortunately consumers suffer in the short term. 
* None of this stuff is sexy, marketable, or generally something consumers care about, so Apple can get away with it
* You've all seen the litigation between the two companies so I won't touch that

Note: I am not an expert and this info is all pulled from publicly available resources. If you have differing information/expertise/opinions I'm all ears!

*EDIT2*: A number of people have accused me of being a Qualcomm employee, or much worse. I suppose given the length of the piece and general psuedojournalistic standards, I should have included a disclosure, so let me do that now: I have not worked for, currently work for, or are in any way affiliated with the companies mentioned in this post, including Qualcomm, Intel, Apple, and Samsung. I have no active financial interest in the aforementioned companies and do not actively own their stock. I'm sure I have some passive interest in all of them via mutual/index funds, like the bulk of people in this thread with a 401k or other investment accounts. 

*EDIT3*: Wow, thanks for the Gold /u/CrookedFinger !",2138.0,iPhone X: Qualcomm vs. Intel - Battery Life & Real World Implications (Long/Technical),https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/79k7vr/iphone_x_qualcomm_vs_intel_battery_life_real/,2017-10-30,"I have tested and able to replicate this issue with 2 different iPhone X's on a few different routers.

The wifi connection will crawl extremely slow and it's damn annoying. From testing this seems to only be an issue on older routers. (And by older I mean not bleeding edge). 

The iPhone X works very well on my company network and using my Ubiquiti router. 

The iPhone X works extremely slow on my average netgear router N300, and a bunch of public wifi, (which is what I expect to be connecting to when I travel, I can't always be on a bleeding edge router) it's also is very slow when connecting to my Fujifilm camera for picture transfers to the point of not being able to transfer a picture over.

I have none of these issues on older wifi networks or photo transfer from a camera when testing on an iPad Mini 2nd Gen, 2 different iPhone 6s, Macbook Pros, Pixel 2.. 

Look at all these other people experiencing this issue. (just two examples I didn't want to paste them all here)

https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/7ytsjq/wifi_slow_on_iphone_x_64gb_silver/

Is this only affecting early batches or specific chipsets? Will exchanging even be worth my time? My friends iPhone X experiences this same phenomena.  

Yes I have tried resetting both wireless settings and resetting the phones, and I am using the latest firmware. 

Is Apple just not addressing this?

One selection is ‘(201.3GB free) and the other selection is Untitled (57.9GB free). When I go to Finder, it looks like the hard drive is named ‘ (apostrophe). I don’t know how that happened. Think that’s causing the import problem - invalid location name or something?",0.0,IMivie and Sony Handyxam,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/8dasb1/imivie_and_sony_handyxam/,,,,

Does anyone know a music app that can auto-play when it opens?  So if I say “Hey Siri, Launch [Music App Name]” it will open and already play music without having to press any other button. My friend can’t afford $10 per month for Apple Music which I know could solve the problem and allow her to request artists, albums etc by Siri. 

A friend of mine is blind and I regularly take her to her doctor appointments. She still has a flip phone that she dials by pressing an old school real key pad with numbers. Yesterday when i went to pick her up for an appointment she told me her phone died on her, wouldn’t respond to charging or anything. I took her to the store and bought her an iPhone 8 Red and AirPods. We activated at the store and then went to her apartment to set everything up. I entered her contact names and phone numbers (99% of the numbers she knew by heart). I went into settings, general, accessibility and turned on Voice Over. We then proceeded to run through all the Siri commands learning what she can do. Tears and laughter followed for the next hour, the iPhone completely opened her world. What an amazing technology for the blind. She started texting her family and they couldn’t believe they were receiving texts from her. Her sister came over immediately asking what in the world was going on. 

She’s on a fixed income and we’re hoping to find her a Music app that will play when it opens without costing a monthly subscription. Her son got her an Alexa speaker for Christmas and she listens to Pandora on it but it would be nice if she could use her iPhone and headphones to listen to music without having to press a Play button that she can’t see. 

A few hours after I left she called me and said that the phone rang and she didn’t have her headphones or AirPods nearby and couldn’t answer the call. Then I suddenly realized I didn’t go over every possibility with her, and in all my reading I didn’t see anything about that. I realized she had consistently answered my calls by tapping on the AirPod or pressing the button on the wired headphones and when they weren’t within reach she missed a call. I called Apple and the first person I spoke with (and his supervisor) couldn’t answer the question of how a blind person can answer the phone without using headphones or AirPods. 

He transferred me to the Siri Accessibility unit. He very quickly told me to have her use 2 fingers to double tap the screen. Sure enough that worked. Problem solved. He also explained where I could go into Settings to set every call for auto-answer if she wanted. 

If all of these functions of the iPhone for the blind weren’t impressive enough, he told me to enter a contact in her phone with their 800 number named Siri Accessibility. Then any time she has a problem working the phone she can say Hey Siri Call Siri Accessibility and it would call their department - which Apple has available 24/7 and even holidays to help the blind, the disabled and those trying to use or help with the special Accessibility functions. 

Kudos to Apple. More than hardware, offering great services for the blind and disabled too. I know I’m already a fanboy and Siri takes much criticism but there is so much that Apple does right.

"#TL;DR

* Android has a status bar and optional multicolored LED indicator.
* [Notifications in the shade](https://i.imgur.com/jgCBymo.png) can rearrange and resize based on content or user preferences. 
* Multiple notifications from the same app can be [summarized](https://i.imgur.com/pkCzrPU.png) or [grouped](https://i.imgur.com/fzKlpT8.png) and expanded.
* (edit) Multiple notifications within the same message thread will just update that one notification, with the recent messages view able upon expansion (will add an example soon).
* [Inline notification replies](https://i.imgur.com/OAFMQPV.mp4) keep the notification the same size.
* App developers have to [set notification channels](https://i.imgur.com/ksNXPBh.png) that define the importance and type of notification; these channels can be activated or deactivated individually by the user and each level of importance alerts the user i different ways. 
* [Ambient display notifications](https://i.imgur.com/XH7ZlzY.png) keep the screen dim and fill the screen for a brief period when they arrive.
* (edit) Notifications stay on your lock screen and status bar until they are opened or dismissed. Lock the device and all the notifications that were there will still be there.
* Media from multiple simultaneous apps can [be controlled through notifications](https://i.imgur.com/UH5xwYq.png)
* [Colored notifications](https://i.imgur.com/p7ifFcP.jpg) help distinguish content.
* (edit) Notifications can also have actionable buttons besides ""reply."" [Here is an example of a timer notification](https://i.imgur.com/G9zoiB5.png) where the user can pause or add time. These actions are hidden until expanded, as seen with [this calendar notification](https://i.imgur.com/OtDQH3i.png).
* (edit) Some notifications can provide [full content preview](https://i.imgur.com/S7vxMuT.png) when expanded.
* (edit) Notifications can provide information on background processes, [like downloading files](https://i.imgur.com/w63bQPG.png).

# Background

I was reading [this thread](https://redd.it/7byc9s) earlier to and got the feeling iOS users were unsatisfied with their notifications. Some users brought up Android's notifications as an example of a good system but many either haven't experienced notifications on Android or had misconceptions about how they are handled.

Some comments:

> Just tell them to copy Android and then alter it slightly with some webOS flair.

>> Can you be more specific? Other than grouping by app, what’s so great about Android notifications?

-

> It's not complicated. Just have it be more like Android and less like whatever it is now. It's pretty safe to say that Google has had it figured out for a while now.

-

> I think its hard to explain, you really just have to own an Android phone for a while and use it to appreciate really how great the notification system is.

-

That's where this post comes in. I'm not here to convert anybody. I used an iPhone for most my life and completely acknowledge the advantages. Both Android and iOS can improve by studying one another and taking the best from both.

---

# Android's System

Most of this is lifted and consolidated from[ Google's Material Design guidelines](https://material.io/guidelines/patterns/notifications.html) so you can read it in full there. I'll try and keep my points to the system not the style.

## How notifications may be noticed

* Showing a status bar icon
* Appearing on the lock screen
* Playing a sound or vibrating
* Peeking onto the current screen
* Blinking the device's LED

The two obvious differences are the LED and status bar. 

The LED is an optional hardware component (actually off by default on some phones like the Pixel) that simply blinks colors depending on your most recent notification; this is actually a huge* deal [to many Android users](https://redd.it/7begkd). 

The status bar is crucial to the Android notification system. On the left side of the status bar are icons for all the pending notifications. These icons stay here until the notification is manually opened or dismissed.

## The notification drawer

https://i.imgur.com/jgCBymo.png

Usually notifications are listed in the drawer in reverse chronological order with the most recent notifications at the top. However, and this is important, this order can be affected by the following things:

* The app's stated notification priority or importance
* Whether the notification recently alerted the user with a sound or vibration
* Any people attached to the notification and whether they are starred contacts
* Whether the notification represents an important ongoing activity, such as a phone call in progress or music playing

In the above image we can see one example of how Android handles notifications differently than iOS. At the very bottom is an unimportant notification regarding the current weather; despite the recentness of this information, it will always appear condensed and at the bottom because it's been set as relatively unimportant.

## Multiple notifications

Here is the most often talked about advantage of Android notifications. There are two different ways Android apps can handle multiple notifications from the same app:

### Summarizing

https://i.imgur.com/pkCzrPU.png

One notification that summarizes them all. A messaging app might have a summary notification that says ""3 new messages.” Upon expansion, it could show a *snippet* for each message.

### Grouping

https://i.imgur.com/fzKlpT8.png

Here is the piece de resistance. Basically all the similar notifications are grouped under one parent. The parent gives the top level information like what app it is and when the most recent of the children arrived.

## Actionable buttons

https://i.imgur.com/G9zoiB5.png

Above is an example of an ongoing notification, where the information is live and the user can either pause or increase said timer. These actions are hidden until expanded, as seen with [this calendar notification](https://i.imgur.com/OtDQH3i.png).

## Inline reply

https://i.imgur.com/OAFMQPV.mp4

Both iOS and Android offer in-notification replying. However, Android keeps the notification the same size instead of popping up to fill the screen.

A feature I really like is the persistence of a notification once I've replied inline. For the Android Messages app, for example, I expand the notification and see a history of the last 5 messages sent (provided you haven't opened the app and have only been using inline reply)

## Full content preview

https://i.imgur.com/S7vxMuT.png

Some notifications can be expanded to allow the user to reveal the full content of the notification.

## Ongoing processes

These types of notifications give the user an update on background processes. A lot of focus in the latest Android updates has gone into providing information through notifications about battery draining problems that have historically plagued Android (I'm not a fan, but they can be informative).

## Notification channels

https://i.imgur.com/ksNXPBh.png

In the latest Android updates, Google has introduced notification categories that allow the user to specify which types of notification they'd like to receive. Supported apps let you turn off certain notification or otherwise change how they arrive separately from other types of notifications from that same app. 

When upgrading their apps to Android 8, developers are required to define channels for each type of notification they want to send. They are also required to set an individual importance for each notification:

* High = Makes a sound and appears on screen
* Default = Makes a sound
* Low = No sound
* Minimum = No sound or visual interruption (LED, peak, ambient display)

## On the lock screen

### Ambient display

https://i.imgur.com/XH7ZlzY.png

On the latest version of Android, the ambient display makes use of the prevelance of AMOLED screens to show notifications without waking up the full display. The majority of the pixels stay off and the notification is presented alone and with larger text.

Users can also double tap the display to get a overview of notifications represented by the status bar icons.

I love being able to swipe away notifications on this ambient display without the whole screen waking up.

### Active display

Notifications can appear like they would in the notification shade: https://i.imgur.com/ryORNyI.png

Or, they can appear in a condensed form if the user doesn't want the content visible: https://i.imgur.com/DYLQLy7.png (fixed)

## Snoozing

https://i.imgur.com/D31tKor.jpg

This is new. Any and all notifications can be snoozed by the OS for 15, 30, 60, for 120 minutes. When that time is up they appear just like they did the first time, using the channel preferences.

## Media controls

https://i.imgur.com/efs9qc3.png

This one is less important with iOS's control center, but I love it so much its worth mentioning. Media on Android is controlled through notifications. Whether it's what's playing on your Chromecast, Google Home speaker, or bluetooth earbuds (all at the same time even) each can be controlled using the notification.

## Colored notifications

https://i.imgur.com/p7ifFcP.jpg

New to Android 8.0 are colored notifications. Calls, timers, navigation, and media can all take different colors to help distinguish controls, information, and messages. You can see how the media notifications colors are derived from the album art, which I find really cool. [Here is an album](https://imgur.com/a/FZPNS) of some examples of how this looks with different album art.

When a message is longer than one sentence, the notification will adjust it's size in the notification shade to let you read the whole thing without manually expanding it.",2952.0,I come in peace from /r/Android to Elaborate on our notifications,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/7c3ale/i_come_in_peace_from_randroid_to_elaborate_on_our/,2017-11-11,Just like in iMessage and other apps to undo text input !,3.0,TIL you can shake your iPhone in Apple Mail to undo last action (archive for example),https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/8eonxm/til_you_can_shake_your_iphone_in_apple_mail_to/,,,,
"#TL;DR

* Android has a status bar and optional multicolored LED indicator.
* [Notifications in the shade](https://i.imgur.com/jgCBymo.png) can rearrange and resize based on content or user preferences. 
* Multiple notifications from the same app can be [summarized](https://i.imgur.com/pkCzrPU.png) or [grouped](https://i.imgur.com/fzKlpT8.png) and expanded.
* (edit) Multiple notifications within the same message thread will just update that one notification, with the recent messages view able upon expansion (will add an example soon).
* [Inline notification replies](https://i.imgur.com/OAFMQPV.mp4) keep the notification the same size.
* App developers have to [set notification channels](https://i.imgur.com/ksNXPBh.png) that define the importance and type of notification; these channels can be activated or deactivated individually by the user and each level of importance alerts the user i different ways. 
* [Ambient display notifications](https://i.imgur.com/XH7ZlzY.png) keep the screen dim and fill the screen for a brief period when they arrive.
* (edit) Notifications stay on your lock screen and status bar until they are opened or dismissed. Lock the device and all the notifications that were there will still be there.
* Media from multiple simultaneous apps can [be controlled through notifications](https://i.imgur.com/UH5xwYq.png)
* [Colored notifications](https://i.imgur.com/p7ifFcP.jpg) help distinguish content.
* (edit) Notifications can also have actionable buttons besides ""reply."" [Here is an example of a timer notification](https://i.imgur.com/G9zoiB5.png) where the user can pause or add time. These actions are hidden until expanded, as seen with [this calendar notification](https://i.imgur.com/OtDQH3i.png).
* (edit) Some notifications can provide [full content preview](https://i.imgur.com/S7vxMuT.png) when expanded.
* (edit) Notifications can provide information on background processes, [like downloading files](https://i.imgur.com/w63bQPG.png).

# Background

I was reading [this thread](https://redd.it/7byc9s) earlier to and got the feeling iOS users were unsatisfied with their notifications. Some users brought up Android's notifications as an example of a good system but many either haven't experienced notifications on Android or had misconceptions about how they are handled.

Some comments:

> Just tell them to copy Android and then alter it slightly with some webOS flair.

>> Can you be more specific? Other than grouping by app, what’s so great about Android notifications?

-

> It's not complicated. Just have it be more like Android and less like whatever it is now. It's pretty safe to say that Google has had it figured out for a while now.

-

> I think its hard to explain, you really just have to own an Android phone for a while and use it to appreciate really how great the notification system is.

-

That's where this post comes in. I'm not here to convert anybody. I used an iPhone for most my life and completely acknowledge the advantages. Both Android and iOS can improve by studying one another and taking the best from both.

---

# Android's System

Most of this is lifted and consolidated from[ Google's Material Design guidelines](https://material.io/guidelines/patterns/notifications.html) so you can read it in full there. I'll try and keep my points to the system not the style.

## How notifications may be noticed

* Showing a status bar icon
* Appearing on the lock screen
* Playing a sound or vibrating
* Peeking onto the current screen
* Blinking the device's LED

The two obvious differences are the LED and status bar. 

The LED is an optional hardware component (actually off by default on some phones like the Pixel) that simply blinks colors depending on your most recent notification; this is actually a huge* deal [to many Android users](https://redd.it/7begkd). 

The status bar is crucial to the Android notification system. On the left side of the status bar are icons for all the pending notifications. These icons stay here until the notification is manually opened or dismissed.

## The notification drawer

https://i.imgur.com/jgCBymo.png

Usually notifications are listed in the drawer in reverse chronological order with the most recent notifications at the top. However, and this is important, this order can be affected by the following things:

* The app's stated notification priority or importance
* Whether the notification recently alerted the user with a sound or vibration
* Any people attached to the notification and whether they are starred contacts
* Whether the notification represents an important ongoing activity, such as a phone call in progress or music playing

In the above image we can see one example of how Android handles notifications differently than iOS. At the very bottom is an unimportant notification regarding the current weather; despite the recentness of this information, it will always appear condensed and at the bottom because it's been set as relatively unimportant.

## Multiple notifications

Here is the most often talked about advantage of Android notifications. There are two different ways Android apps can handle multiple notifications from the same app:

### Summarizing

https://i.imgur.com/pkCzrPU.png

One notification that summarizes them all. A messaging app might have a summary notification that says ""3 new messages.” Upon expansion, it could show a *snippet* for each message.

### Grouping

https://i.imgur.com/fzKlpT8.png

Here is the piece de resistance. Basically all the similar notifications are grouped under one parent. The parent gives the top level information like what app it is and when the most recent of the children arrived.

## Actionable buttons

https://i.imgur.com/G9zoiB5.png

Above is an example of an ongoing notification, where the information is live and the user can either pause or increase said timer. These actions are hidden until expanded, as seen with [this calendar notification](https://i.imgur.com/OtDQH3i.png).

## Inline reply

https://i.imgur.com/OAFMQPV.mp4

Both iOS and Android offer in-notification replying. However, Android keeps the notification the same size instead of popping up to fill the screen.

A feature I really like is the persistence of a notification once I've replied inline. For the Android Messages app, for example, I expand the notification and see a history of the last 5 messages sent (provided you haven't opened the app and have only been using inline reply)

## Full content preview

https://i.imgur.com/S7vxMuT.png

Some notifications can be expanded to allow the user to reveal the full content of the notification.

## Ongoing processes 

https://i.imgur.com/w63bQPG.png

These types of notifications give the user an update on background processes. A lot of focus in the latest Android updates has gone into providing information through notifications about battery draining problems that have historically plagued Android (I'm not a fan, but they can be informative).

As many of you have, I have been using Bug Reporter to report issues in the iOS 11.4 beta, and it seems as if Apple does not care. Does not care about the issues in High Sierra, about the mess that is iOS 11.

I have reported countless issues, spend half an hour of my time, preparing sysdiagnose outputs, screenshots, and filling out the reports as detailed as I can. And what to I get:

*""Please know that this is expected behavior""*: the bug is a feature? I reported an issue with the Volume image not updating anymore, and its an EXPECTED FEATURE?

*Engineering has determined that your bug report is a duplicate of another issue and will be closed.*: I have only submitted one of these issues, can someone tell me what is going on?

*Please submit this feedback via the feedback web portal.*: why?



We track such feedback for possible future action.: POSSIBLE further action, you HAVE TO BE KIDDING ME???


If Apple wants it's operating system to be better, THEY NEED TO LISTEN, not give me this sh!t, time after time, after time. This is really starting to get to me, and I wonder. Is there any point in reporting a bug, which they obviously don't want to be fixed?

Sigh.

But Siri knows my voice...other people cannot activate ""hey Siri"" on my phone for that very reason. So, why does Apple require that you unlock the phone to do certain things when it knows my voice? Why can't my voice act as the password?

,2460.0,Apple Ranked as 'Clear Leader' in its Efforts to Source Conflict-Free Minerals From Supply Chain,https://www.macrumors.com/2017/11/16/apple-clear-leader-conflict-free-minerals/,2017-11-17,"I love magsafe. I love that it protects my computer. I love that it’s so easy to attach. It’s amazing.

But, I hate how expensive they are to replace. They’re $80. And you have to replace the whole thing when that tiny little cord splits at the end. 

So then Apple comes out with USB—C charging and objectively its better in every way except the non-magnetic part. It’s multifunctional, it’s smaller, it’s compatible with more devices. Oh, and it’s cheaper. When I inevitably run the end of the cable over with my rolling chair, it’s only like $20 to replace the cable instead of having to swap the whole power supply brick.

I’d love for apple to combine these two things. I know I can get a 3rd party thing to bring back the magnetism, but what I’m really asking for is for Apple to sell a cable that’s USB-C on one end and MagSafe on the other. Then the next time I have to replace my charger (it’s only happened twice since 2013, so I’m not a complete animal), instead of spending $80 on a new power brick and cable that are one unit, I just get the new USB-C power supply and USB-C to MagSafe cable for the same price. Then when the cable wears out, it’s only $20 to fix. 

Apple wins too because they can stop manufacturing all the old MagSafe 1 & 2 power supply’s and switch to just making the new power supply and several cables.

They've long been one of my favorite features of the platform.

In 10.7 Lion, they started the process of gradually ruining the feature. The glory days of an [arbitrarily-defined grid of virtual desktops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaces_\(software\)#/media/File:Spaces_\(Mac_OS_X_software\).png) were replaced with the Exposé/linear spaces mashup known as [Mission Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Control_\(macOS\)#/media/File:Mac_OS_X_Lion_Preview_-_Mission_Control.jpg).

This was a shame. The grid allowed you to have whatever quantity of virtual desktops you wanted. The previews were large enough so that you could see the contents of all of them at a glance. You could set up keyboard shortcuts to navigate them spatially in an intuitive/muscle memory manner. Mission Control forced you into a linear model, shoved the Spaces into tiny little thumbnails on the top of the screen, and eliminated the ability to navigate more than a few desktops easily via muscle memory.

Over time, I've slowly come to terms with the realization that MacOS's glory days of virtual desktop grids weren't coming back. (Yes, there are 3rd party tools such as TotalSpaces, but they require disabling system integrity to install. I'm wary of third party tools doing code injection into Dock.app)

I tend to be working on multiple different projects at once. I group my desktops by projects. In its current incarnation, even on a 5K iMac, [the Space thumbnails are impossibly tiny and unintuitive to navigate](https://i.imgur.com/WwHPGgB.jpg), I get lost constantly in my own desktops. But I still need a way to logically group together numerous open application windows.

But one insignificantly small change would improve my ability to tolerate the current iteration of MacOS: **Let me name the desktops**.

Currently, full-screen applications are displayed as a Space with the app name as the label. Everything else is labeled ""Desktop 1, Desktop 2, Desktop 3"" etc. These generic labels sit there taunting you, as you struggle to figure out what is actually on that desktop.

If I could simply choose my own useful label ie ""Project 1 Code"", ""Project 2 Research"", ""Email/Slack"", it would give me an enormous boost to my productivity.

"I recently got the iPhone X, making the jump from Android because what the hell, why not? So far I’ve been enjoying the X immensely, but I developed a hairline crack on the screen. I didn’t know where it came from.

So, I went to the Apple Store near me and inquired. They set up an appointment with the Genius Bar, and ten minutes later (despite a long wait schedule) I was in front of a guy. He explains that it is a scratch and thus user fault, but he went in to confirm. He came back saying that it was definitely a scratch but he’ll throw it under the warranty just for my sake. He was super cool about it.

So, I come 2 hours later to pick up the repaired phone, only to find out that they had run out of the repair parts at the local facility. I was like, “man, now they’re going to have to ship it out for a repair”. Nope. They replace the phone with a brand new one, right out the box. 

So now I’m walking out with a fresh X that costed me exactly nada. The process was fast and the reps were amazing. After dealing with the exact opposite with T-Mobile, this is such a breath of fresh air. Might not seem like much to other people, but Apple really just made a customer for life.

"I've seen a lot of posts and comments on how outrageous it is to be throttling a battery while it still has 80 % of its capacity. I can speak from a scientific background, and I'd like to try and clarify some things, and hopefully lower your pitchforks slightly.

Batteries don't really work in the range of what we would consider to be healthy. With posts like [these](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/7lkdur/i_went_to_the_apple_store_after_seeing_my/) it's clear that there are some misconceptions about how they age. I mean, a 20% capacity loss doesn't seem so bad right? But, while 83% may still seem high to you, typically 70-80% of the original capacity is considered to be the end of life^[1](http://shop.tarjomeplus.com/Uploads/site-1/DownloadDoc/1061.pdf),[2](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013468617302979) (EOL) of a Li-ion battery. 

They function by shuttling lithium ions between graphite and another material. Over time these materials become stressed and damaged. During this, there are dozens of internal side reactions that occur which also damage and age the cell. The main causes of cell death are:

* Repeated cycling damages and cracks the graphite anode, lowering the amount of ions able to be intercalated into it
* Lithium metal plates on the anode and can pose thermal risk, also lowers total Li-ions available for cycling
* Passivation layers increase cell resistance past a practically useable point, and the cell cannot draw peak current

The last one, especially, is why sudden shutdowns at 50% occur. Batteries are dynamic chemical systems, and they can only perform at maximum for a limited number of cycles. To be clear, 80% of original capacity is NOT the reason for the end of life, but the indicator of these other processes. For iPhones at this point, they have chosen to throttle instead of allowing for sudden shutdowns. From a scientific perspective (and without dumping a ton of graphs and images on you) this is perfectly reasonable. 

I understand from a consumer perspective that you just want your things to work for as long as possible, and you don't want to know why they fail. Apple is good at hiding a lot of nitty gritty from us, but batteries are only as good as the chemistry inside them. There is no magic fix to increase cycle numbers or life, just research. Which is why scientists are so hard at work on developing new technologies. 

TL;DR:
Capacity loss is an indicator of other processes. 80% capacity is approximately the established end of life of a Li-ion battery. Performance is degraded, and unable to keep up with peak demand. Throttling as a reasonable trade-off at this point compared to sudden shutdowns.

"I often go researching apps on the app store to see what's trending, inspiration for app ideas, look at nice UI designs etc. 
This morning I came across this app which is currently ranked #26 in their category and had over 	67,882 all 5 star reviews. Yes, you read that right, all 5 star reviews despite only being available since September 15, 2017.

As soon as I read the name and rating, my bullshit meter went ding dong and I got extremely curious on how they have acheived such high ranking? Let's dig a bit.

----------------

The name is ""One Night Stand - Adult Hook up Tonight"" - if Ashley Maddison's ""Have an affair"" was too bold for you, this isn't that bad. Who doesn't want to have instant sex at a moment's notice with a complete stranger right? But any how, I digress. Let's move on to the app icon. Sure beauty is subjective but I would expect such a top rated dating app to have a bit better looking icon.

Let's look at the promotional text: ""Looking for someone who wanna find a dating with top hot singles and love adventures. Find the real dates online. Help you hook up with the one you interested in.""

I am an immigrant and English isn't my first language. But I am pretty sure there's a ton of grammatical errors in this. App claims ""real dates"". ROFL. ""Top hot singles"" & ""love adventures"". LMFAO.

----------------

Let's read the description. I am going to trim this down a bit because I can only handle bullshit to a limit. 

*""If you are a good talker, maybe you can hookup with someone on a beautiful night. Drag your photos & fill in your profile, with a click of mouse, you can check the one you like and chat with him/her directly. Start a chat freely since it’s your time to show and you may meet the one you like and hookup now.""*

**Click of a mouse eh. I didn't know Apple replaced the headphone jack with a fucking mouse.**

*""Get ready to a new dating with someone you like, enjoy chatting with him/her or dive into the world of passion and desire. All you need is our app One Night Stand. Search One Night Stand in iTunes now and be ready for a new life here. meet your fate one
Still shame to share your expression with others? Wanna make yourself more attractive? Eager to meet someone you like and wanna hookup with him/her directly. One Night Stand is your best choice. With all benefits above, you can enjoy more while you wanna hookup with someone.
Find the real one online, meet the one you like nearby & One Night Stand will help you hook up with the one you interested in.
Now, download it, and then meet the one you love!""*

**MAN, I AM SOOOO GETTING LAID TONIGHTTTT!!! Just gotta buy this 1 Week at 19.99 USD in app purchase and I will make all kinds of ""love adventures"" with the ""top hot singles"". Or maybe I will go for the 3 months at 69.99 USD. 69 nomsayin ;)**

*""As our app enables the display of users' locations on a map, to help you find users nearby you, and before display your information, we would request for your permission, you have right to reject it and don’t use the feature, if you turn on the location sharing, then keep an eye on unfriendly person and fake information.""*

**I am no rocket scientist but I am sure this app is the definition of ""fake information"".**

----------------

Let's move on to the reviews. I don't like the iOS 11 app store review system, so I use Appannie to look at all the reviews.

The app has received a total of 68,066 reviews since inception. 
I sorted them to show ""5 star only"". I am a developer myself and my mind was absolutely blown with 	67,882 all 5 star reviews. Man, even Apollo for Reddit has only received a total of 3800 reviews with only 3100 5 star reviews. So this dating app must be exceptionally good. /s

Let's look at the name of the last few reviewers:
Maria84, 7Linda, 84Peter, Howard35, 61Nicola, Boyle33, Geoffrey93, Jones24, 66Celeste, Maggie42, Doyle19, 46Letitia,  18Michelle.

Anyone notice a pattern in these names? It's like someone left a phone directory inside a for loop.

No, I didn't make a typo pasting the same review twice. That's the same exact text, down to the typos reviewed by hundreds of different people within a few minutes. There's hundreds of reviews which start with the exact same first few lowercase characters, then a random word in upper case. There's another pattern of pasting some other popular app's name in the review - probably for ASO (App store optimization) purposes to get better ranking in the store. Some reviewers claim to get 9 month long relationships from a 3 month old **""one night stand""** app.

Now, sure, there are real reviews too which are all 1 star reviews warning everyone else about the scam but 3000 1 star real reviews easily get overpowered by 67000 5 star fake ones.

----------------

Let's look at the screenshots. App uses pictures of attractive women as you would expect from most dating apps. However let's dig a bit deeper. I downloaded the screenshots and did a reverse google search with them. These pictures are straight up stolen from someone's instagram profile and other chive articles with titles ""Sometimes you gotta let them breathe"" with pictures of women with big tits.

----------------

Next let's estimate the downloads and revenue for this app. For this, we go use SensorTower. For November, it estimates 70,000 downloads and $200,000 revenue. Now I know that sensor tower estimations aren't that accurate but for an app which is #26 in the store, I won't be surprised if this number were actually close enough. Considering this app has been available since September 15th and Christmas is when apps get the most revenue, I won't be surprised if they had scammed half a million by taking advantage of gullible people.

**EDIT:**

I downloaded the app to test it and no surprises, was bombarded with a ton of fake messages from obviously fake ""milfs"". But unfortunately, I couldn't read most of the messages as I couldn't afford to buy a $69 in app purchase. App was also filled with obvious typos, misspellings like ""Reciving info"" etc. Didn't bother wasting too much time on the app.

If anyone is interested, here are 2 copies of this app. I am not sure if they are different apps or the same because my browser shows them with the same icon but slightly different names. **Be careful if you download this, it will bombard you with popups asking you to subscribe to the in app purchase. Keep your finger OFF of the home button unless you want to accidentally buy the $69 IAP and hook up with some hot singles!**

Can we all please discuss how such scam gets around the app review team when us developers often have to go through such a strict app review on our legitimate apps? Can we also please discuss the completely broken rating system and how such app has been available on the store for over 3 months despite being reported countless times and despite getting thousands of fake 5 star reviews?

There were a few other posts couple months ago about apps claiming to be antivirus software but were just scam. This proves disparity in the app review system for legitimate apps vs such scam apps. 

**Proposed solutions:**

1.	Have some trigger which auto flags any app which is climbing up the rankings or getting too many reviews too fast and then have some human manually verify it?
2.	Flag reviews which have the same text.
3.	If an app has a subscription model OR very expensive pricing, pay extra attention while reviewing the app.
4.	Pay attention when reviewing apps and shit like “click of a mouse”, “Drag photos”, “Play store” should be easy to identify scams. When I submit my apps, they go through extreme scrutiny and often get rejected for silly stuff (example: Restore button not available for IAP - even though it actually is, App was rated 9+ and should be higher even though I rated the app 17+). So I wonder how these ones get through. 
5.	Why is reporting an app so hard on iOS? I can’t find a report button anywhere on the app page. Ended up using the support website to report it. 
6.     iOS 11 App store has no way to sort/filter reviews. So if you look at this app, it ONLY shows you the 5 star ratings ONLY. Completely hides the 1 star reviews which deceives the consumer. The app store should have a filter for sorting by time/rating, filtering by number of stars, should let you see other reviews from the same user etc.


**EDIT:** Check out a google docs data dump of all the reviews here:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wPKwLd8BIX3AFVFkSFQcPqqYMKBUd19StG_UT24s_tc/edit?usp=sharing

**EDIT:** Few people are asking me why I went through such extent to expose this? I did network security in school, so this is up my alley. Plus, I am a developer and make my living off of the app store, so this kind of stuff personally impacts me. Maybe I am jealous that a shady app is taking a spot in the top rankings which could be taken by real apps and also reducing the trust of regular people in the app store and making them skeptical about legitimate apps and in app purchases too. So when they would come across one of my legitimate apps with legitimate 5 star reviews, they would be skeptical. This stuff erodes the trust in a marketplace and should be exposed. Is it bad then that I am frustrated and outraged? You tell me.

Am I still able to purchase AppleCare for the watch? Or would it not work since someone else may have bought it previously? I was under the impression that you had a certain amount of days to buy after purchase. Thanks!",2.0,Question about AppleCare for Apple Watch,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/8ffaay/question_about_applecare_for_apple_watch/,,,,
"I often go researching apps on the app store to see what's trending, inspiration for app ideas, look at nice UI designs etc. 
This morning I came across this app which is currently ranked #26 in their category and had over 	67,882 all 5 star reviews. Yes, you read that right, all 5 star reviews despite only being available since September 15, 2017.

As soon as I read the name and rating, my bullshit meter went ding dong and I got extremely curious on how they have acheived such high ranking? Let's dig a bit.

----------------

The name is ""One Night Stand - Adult Hook up Tonight"" - if Ashley Maddison's ""Have an affair"" was too bold for you, this isn't that bad. Who doesn't want to have instant sex at a moment's notice with a complete stranger right? But any how, I digress. Let's move on to the app icon. Sure beauty is subjective but I would expect such a top rated dating app to have a bit better looking icon.

Let's look at the promotional text: ""Looking for someone who wanna find a dating with top hot singles and love adventures. Find the real dates online. Help you hook up with the one you interested in.""

I am an immigrant and English isn't my first language. But I am pretty sure there's a ton of grammatical errors in this. App claims ""real dates"". ROFL. ""Top hot singles"" & ""love adventures"". LMFAO.

----------------

Let's read the description. I am going to trim this down a bit because I can only handle bullshit to a limit. 

*""If you are a good talker, maybe you can hookup with someone on a beautiful night. Drag your photos & fill in your profile, with a click of mouse, you can check the one you like and chat with him/her directly. Start a chat freely since it’s your time to show and you may meet the one you like and hookup now.""*

**Click of a mouse eh. I didn't know Apple replaced the headphone jack with a fucking mouse.**

*""Get ready to a new dating with someone you like, enjoy chatting with him/her or dive into the world of passion and desire. All you need is our app One Night Stand. Search One Night Stand in iTunes now and be ready for a new life here. meet your fate one
Still shame to share your expression with others? Wanna make yourself more attractive? Eager to meet someone you like and wanna hookup with him/her directly. One Night Stand is your best choice. With all benefits above, you can enjoy more while you wanna hookup with someone.
Find the real one online, meet the one you like nearby & One Night Stand will help you hook up with the one you interested in.
Now, download it, and then meet the one you love!""*

**MAN, I AM SOOOO GETTING LAID TONIGHTTTT!!! Just gotta buy this 1 Week at 19.99 USD in app purchase and I will make all kinds of ""love adventures"" with the ""top hot singles"". Or maybe I will go for the 3 months at 69.99 USD. 69 nomsayin ;)**

*""As our app enables the display of users' locations on a map, to help you find users nearby you, and before display your information, we would request for your permission, you have right to reject it and don’t use the feature, if you turn on the location sharing, then keep an eye on unfriendly person and fake information.""*

**I am no rocket scientist but I am sure this app is the definition of ""fake information"".**

----------------

Let's move on to the reviews. I don't like the iOS 11 app store review system, so I use Appannie to look at all the reviews.

The app has received a total of 68,066 reviews since inception. 
I sorted them to show ""5 star only"". I am a developer myself and my mind was absolutely blown with 	67,882 all 5 star reviews. Man, even Apollo for Reddit has only received a total of 3800 reviews with only 3100 5 star reviews. So this dating app must be exceptionally good. /s

Let's look at the name of the last few reviewers:
Maria84, 7Linda, 84Peter, Howard35, 61Nicola, Boyle33, Geoffrey93, Jones24, 66Celeste, Maggie42, Doyle19, 46Letitia,  18Michelle.

Anyone notice a pattern in these names? It's like someone left a phone directory inside a for loop.

No, I didn't make a typo pasting the same review twice. That's the same exact text, down to the typos reviewed by hundreds of different people within a few minutes. There's hundreds of reviews which start with the exact same first few lowercase characters, then a random word in upper case. There's another pattern of pasting some other popular app's name in the review - probably for ASO (App store optimization) purposes to get better ranking in the store. Some reviewers claim to get 9 month long relationships from a 3 month old **""one night stand""** app.

Now, sure, there are real reviews too which are all 1 star reviews warning everyone else about the scam but 3000 1 star real reviews easily get overpowered by 67000 5 star fake ones.

----------------

Let's look at the screenshots. App uses pictures of attractive women as you would expect from most dating apps. However let's dig a bit deeper. I downloaded the screenshots and did a reverse google search with them. These pictures are straight up stolen from someone's instagram profile and other chive articles with titles ""Sometimes you gotta let them breathe"" with pictures of women with big tits.

----------------

Next let's estimate the downloads and revenue for this app. For this, we go use SensorTower. For November, it estimates 70,000 downloads and $200,000 revenue. Now I know that sensor tower estimations aren't that accurate but for an app which is #26 in the store, I won't be surprised if this number were actually close enough. Considering this app has been available since September 15th and Christmas is when apps get the most revenue, I won't be surprised if they had scammed half a million by taking advantage of gullible people.

**EDIT:**

I downloaded the app to test it and no surprises, was bombarded with a ton of fake messages from obviously fake ""milfs"". But unfortunately, I couldn't read most of the messages as I couldn't afford to buy a $69 in app purchase. App was also filled with obvious typos, misspellings like ""Reciving info"" etc. Didn't bother wasting too much time on the app.

If anyone is interested, here are 2 copies of this app. I am not sure if they are different apps or the same because my browser shows them with the same icon but slightly different names. **Be careful if you download this, it will bombard you with popups asking you to subscribe to the in app purchase. Keep your finger OFF of the home button unless you want to accidentally buy the $69 IAP and hook up with some hot singles!**

I figure, what the heck. It's only $4.99 and I've used 1Blocker Legacy for over 2 years.

The main reason why I prefer to remain in 1Blocker ecosystem is that I have a ton of custom rules. And unlike most, 1Blocker syncs custom rules between iOS and macOS \(I believe Purify does this also, but I haven't had much luck using Purify\).

Anyway, I upgraded for two reasons.

**1. Partial Whitelist**

Partial Whitelist lets you whitelist certain type of blockers. For instance, there are many websites that pops up ad blocker warning if the tracker is blocked. If I unblock the trackers, ads on many of these websites will continued to be blocked.

Conversely, there are websites that displays only few ads. But I still want to block social widgets, etc. In these cases, I can allow ads while blocking all the rest.

Well, this is all very promising. Except for one thing: Partial Whitelist is NOT YET IMPLEMENTED! So I am basically ""HomePodded"" once again. I asked developer about the rough release date. Just as I suspected, the developer hasn't said a word. Their website doesn't mention 1Blocker X either, so good luck finding information there.

I am sure they are busy serving initial onslaught of requests, but if my past experiences are any indication, they rarely respond.

**2. Multiple Extensions**

Currently, 1Blocker X has over 121,000 rules, which is beyond iOS's 50,000 rules limit. This is accomplished by a little trick that I suspect will be copied by its competitors real soon. It simply installs multiple content blocker extensions, 7 in the current version \(7 times 50,000 = 350,000\).

My previous blocker of choice, Wipr, has hit this limit already. So I want more scalable Content Blocker. Until this little trick is copied, 1Blocker X is the only game in town.

**Conclusion**

So does it work? Like I said, Partial Whitelist is not yet implemented.

Compared to 1Blocker Legacy, the experience isn't dramatically different. It could be placebo, but it does seem that I am seeing fewer ads and annoyances. And hopefully, I am being tracked less.

The UI looks a bit more polished, but let's face it. I rarely interact with content blocker's UI.

All in all, probably not yet worth the upgrade unless you feel charitable and wants to support the developer. I remain largely neutral, but 30&#37; limited time discount made me a sucker.

IMO, the developer should've offered Partial Whitelist \(e.g., $0.99\) and Multiple Extensions \(e.g., $2.99\) as  IAP to the existing app. That would've prevented a lot of angry customers while keeping them honest \(1Blocker's tag line is ""only blocker you need""\).",55.0,So I bought 1Blocker X,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/8fec0d/so_i_bought_1blocker_x/,,,,

My previous blocker of choice, Wipr, has hit this limit already. So I want more scalable Content Blocker. Until this little trick is copied, 1Blocker X is the only game in town.

**Conclusion**

So does it work? Like I said, Partial Whitelist is not yet implemented.

Compared to 1Blocker Legacy, the experience isn't dramatically different. It could be placebo, but it does seem that I am seeing fewer ads and annoyances. And hopefully, I am being tracked less.

The UI looks a bit more polished, but let's face it. I rarely interact with content blocker's UI.

All in all, probably not yet worth the upgrade unless you feel charitable and wants to support the developer. I remain largely neutral, but 30&#37; limited time discount made me a sucker.

IMO, the developer should've offered Partial Whitelist \(e.g., $0.99\) and Multiple Extensions \(e.g., $2.99\) as  IAP to the existing app. That would've prevented a lot of angry customers while keeping them honest \(1Blocker's tag line is ""only blocker you need""\).",55.0,So I bought 1Blocker X,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/8fec0d/so_i_bought_1blocker_x/,,,,

I got myself an iMac 27 5K last fall and was also thrilled to use the new keyboard with it. The keyboard is okay-ish but some key presses just don't register on the first press, which immensely annoys me.

I was looking into getting a mechanical keyboard, but also wanted to keep aestetics in my setup. I'm looking for a keyboard that is...

1. Wireless (Bluetooth would be great!)
2. White
3. Fullsize (don't really like tenkeyless)

Ideally it would also have apple keys but I think I could do without. A friend of mine found the Drevo Calibur keyboard, but only tenkeyless :(

"Since purchasing iPhone X I’ve suffered from eye strain, headaches, and throbbing pain behind my eyes. It’s disappointing that I can’t use my new iPhone without some degree of pain, but what’s most concerning is that these symptoms persist for hours after usage.

This is most likely due to Apple’s utilization of Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), which flickers the display at varying frequencies depending on the brightness level. Apple has avoided using this technology on previous iPhones, but evidently had to incorporate it to utilize Samsung’s OLED panel. This represents a major compromise for the sensitive few. 

While many do not experience issues from it, users may be sensitive to PWM without even realizing it’s present. It’s the minority of users, but it’s a significant minority especially considering that this can extend into being a medical issue. 

Basically, the iPhone X flickers *a lot* in a manner that’s supposed to be indiscernible to the human eye but for some users this aggressive, varying flicker can cause a whole host of health issues. Noticeable or not, this is not ideal for the eyes especially with hours of daily usage. 

To demonstrate what this means in practice, I’ve filmed two quick videos using the iPhone’s slo-mo camera mode. One demonstrating the flicker on iPhone X at varying brightness levels, the other the iPhone 8 Plus which doesn’t utilize PWM.

"I am getting annoyed seeing AutoModerator remove posts in /r/Apple all because the mods want to decrease the number of questions in this subreddit.

It's my opinion that people asking questions are part of what make this subreddit thrive. I have answered many questions, small and large, and people have done the same for me.

"A bit of backstory:

For the longest time, I used my old 2012 MacBook Pro, even though the battery died very quickly, it was bulky compared to the newer MacBooks, and had started to slow down quite significantly.

Even so, I was able to be really productive using it, specifically when it came to writing... I could type for hours on my old 2012 MacBook Pro and not get tired. I loved using it, loved typing on it, loved working on it, would bring it with me everywhere. 

Finally, I decided to upgrade and switched to a top-of-the-line 2017 MacBook Pro 13"" with TouchBar. It was sexy, it was thin, the keyboard wasn't as comfortable to type on, but hey, it made a nice 'clack' sound when you pressed the keys.

Over the next few months, though, I realized my productivity had been significantly falling. I had stopped writing for pleasure, and would only type when I absolutely had to. I used my MacBook more like an iPad — browsing, clicking, scrolling. I 'liked' my new MacBook, but I didn't love it like my old 2012 MacBook.

I suspected the keyboard was holding me back, but I didn't realize how bad it really was. After all, I was using the second-generation butterfly keyboard. Wasn't it supposed to be better than the first one?

Then I read a post by [/u/7506blasting](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/7fke97/why_apple_wont_do_what_marco_wants_to_fix_the/dqcuaxy/):

> The [butterfly] keyboard is objectively bad. We've had decades of research into ergonomics, we know what works. The mac pro keyboard puts all the shock of a key impact, and more strain on your fingers than any other keyboard I've used. It's only marginally better than typing on a tablet. No travel means no cushioning. It's like punching a wall instead of a bag.
> 
> Of course we get used to it (we can get used to anything, even typing on phones - doesn't mean it isn't hugely inferior) but all the strain is now on your finger. You have to press lightly - but try doing that when you're in the flow, tired at the end of the day, when you've already put out thousands of words and just want to be done. I'm genuinely concerned a year or two of using this keyboard would bring me very close to RSI, arthritis, or any other joint issues in my hands. 

And that was it. I finally saw how bad the keyboard was (for me).

I couldn't go back to my 2012 MacBook Pro (it really was slow at this point), so I went on eBay and found a top-of-the-line MacBook Pro 2015... the last MacBook with a comfortable, usable, meant-for-writing keyboard.

Holy shit.

The difference stunned me. The 'old' keyboard was so much better than the 'butterfly keyboard' that I had to put up with for months. I didn't have to hammer away at the keys. My fingers danced across the keyboard and the familiar 'mushy' keys responded quickly and easily. It was an absolute joy.

All the love I felt for the Mac came back. This was a real laptop. This was a real machine that I could use for work, that was designed to be typed on.

And on top of that, the little things. Having dedicated volume buttons on the top row. Dedicated pause/play button. And USB-A ports. Wow. Being able to use *any* old cable or external drive, without thinking of finding an adapter? It was pure luxury.

I am never giving up this laptop. I'm even thinking of buying another one and just keeping it in my closet for the eventual day that this one might die.

I don't see Apple going back to the old, comfortable, fantastic keyboards, like the one on the 2015 model. They're too obsessed with thinness and too proud to reverse a decision like that. (And some people do seem to like the butterfly keyboard, which makes the whole situation even more muddled).

Which basically means that... the 2015 MacBook Pro is the last MacBook I'll ever truly love. If we're gonna keep using the butterfly keyboard in the 2018, 2019, 2020 MacBooks, there's no way that I can go back to that hell. (And it is hell, for me, when your work depends on you typing and you're given a sub-par keyboard.)

I don't know at what point Apple shifted from aesthetics/usability balance to just the aesthetics, but I find it extremely sad. I love the Mac, I love macOS, I want to keep using the platform. For now, I still can. But I don't know what I'm gonna do five or ten years from now.

If you're using one of the 2016 or 2017 MacBooks and you find your productivity falling or you're not writing as much as you used to, I urge you to look into switching back to an older Mac or at least a different external keyboard.

This is a sad sad day. I nearly slipped about 20 minutes ago and dropped my iPhone in the process. The back is shattered, the front is fine.

1. I read that I can add AppleCare after purchase. If this is true and I did that, would this fall under the accidental damage column and be covered? (I believe it covers up to 2 accidental damages)

2. If option 1 is a no go, can it be replaced or not? It looks like a damn process in the videos I’ve watched. Does this mean I need a whole new iPhone X? Bc Im not gunna lie I’m a college student that definitely cannot afford another iPhone X.

3. If it can be replaced, what are the costs? (The back glass that is) I’d much rather pay $3-500 for a new back than another $1200 for an iPhone.

4. If all this is a no go, should I just buy a case to cover the once-so-beautiful phone? I love this phone, looks so classy and beautiful imho, but now its ruined (in appearance)

"I didn't fill all my rings every day for a year, which is incredibly impressive, but I felt inspired to share my story regardless.

In June of 2016, my son had turned two years old, and I weighed 276 pounds. I have strong memories of my own dad, always a bigger guy, who I would compete with when it came to eating. In other words, I was a kid, trying out-eat a grown man, and as an adult I wanted to be a better example for my son. It should come as no surprise that, decades later, my dad is suffering through things like Type 2 diabetes, he survived a heart attack, and in general he has a lot of trouble getting around. Looking at him, I knew that that was not how I wanted to live the later years of my own life.

I started out by consulting with a doctor, and developing an intensive diet change and exercising. I walked daily for 30-40 minutes, and with the modified intake, I saw my weight loss change dramatically at a pretty quick rate. 

By late October, only three months into my diet, I'd dropped about 50 pounds. I also found that my walk wasn't challenging anymore. Through using my Apple Watch, I always checked my heart rate while walking, doing my best to keep it above 125. However, there were points on my walk where, no matter how fast I went, I was unable to keep my rate that high - so, I just started running one day. It happened about two weeks before I turned 37. For literally the first time in my life, I ran one mile without stopping. Within two weeks, I was running 5K daily.

Within 10 months of my diet's start, I had dropped 100 pounds and hit my target weight. That was February of last year. Since then, like a lot of dieters, I've seen some weight come back, but I'm still in a healthy weight range and I still run every day. I owe my success to my Apple Watch - using it to track my fitness and close my circles, I've continued running, even in weather as cold as -26C. I've run through mounds of snow, on sheets of ice, in insane heat, on ridiculously humid days, you name it. 

I am now a year into being a healthy weight, and I am a good example to my son, who is now 3.5 years old. On a nearly nightly basis, he announces that he's going for a run, before he starts running circles around the main floor of our house. In a year or two, I will start taking him running for real. 

So, on top reaching a weight I'd not been at since I was 11 or 12, I've now run well over a thousand kilometres (probably approaching 2K soon). I've dramatically improved my blood pressure, my cholesterol, and my overall health. But most importantly, I've become a good example for my son. Hopefully, I will live a long healthy life, because I want to see as much of his as is possible. 

I owe a lot of my success to tracking calories on my iPhone, and tracking calories burned on my Apple Watch. Apple has done a great job with this product. It has literally changed my life.

When using bluetooth headphones, there is no static sound but after using the headphones for ~30 minutes, they will develop a very noticeable delay when watching video.

"I like to develop in Unity/VS Code on the couch/on the go and even with a brand new battery, my 6 year old mbp only gets ~2 hours (I can get 5-6 if I only code) even with gfxCardStatus set to Integrated Only. Now most of the time (2/3rds? 3/4ths?) I am just coding, so Unity is running in the background chewing up battery for no reason. I could just shut down Unity when I'm not using it, but then I am less likely to test my code and iterate.

But as I was looking at the Energy tab in Activity Monitor, I saw this column: App Nap. That's the feature that suspends the app when it is not in use (or something like that). But Unity (along with many apps) does not support it. So I did some searching and cobbled together enough bits from StackOverflow to make my own app nap script.

Introducing [MyAppNap](https://github.com/omikun/MyAppNap), ~~just fire up Terminal, type 'python myAppNap.py Unity' and it will suspend that app when it is not in focus and resume it once it is.~~ Check out [ForceNap](https://github.com/omikun/MyAppNap/releases/tag/v0.4) if you are brave or wait a few more days or until it is stable.

It's free and open source and should not require anything extra (runs on the python that comes with Mac OS). Though I've only tested this on Sierra on a 2012 15"" rMBP, so if you run into any issues, let me know! This is the first script I've written that's meaningfully useful. I now can get roughly 4-5 hours of battery life while working with Unity every once in a while.

*TLDR* If you are running some battery-hogging-app that you use intermittently but want to keep open, give [MyAppNap](https://github.com/omikun/MyAppNap) a try.

/Self-promotion Saturday

Edit> I didn't expect this to take off! I'm really happy for all the interest and I'll look into making it more user friendly, put it in a menu bar, maybe prepopulate a list of all your apps so you can just select one (or more?) at a time.

Edit2> I haven't had time to go through all the comments yet, but thank you all for your support! I have merged with a couple of enhancements from the community. Now it will suspend all defocused apps if invoked with no arguments, or suspend multiple apps if invoked with multiple app names. Up next: integrate with Rumps and turn it into an app, so anyone download it, open it, and select the apps they want to suspend without going into Terminal.

Edit3> March 4th PST 17:33 I've been coding all day and have pushed a lot of updates. The repo isn't too steady right now so please hold off on using it unless you have more experience with Python than me (I just took an intro to python course a couple months back). I am getting help from the community, signed on a collaborator, and have a rudimentary status bar app version working (very experimental, lots of bugs). I'll update again with a better estimate on when a user friendly version will be released. Again, thanks for all the support.

**RELEASE UPDATE**
Edit4> March 4th PST 23:20 Just managed to build a status bar version, I call it: [ForceNap](https://github.com/omikun/MyAppNap/releases/tag/v0.4). It is still experimental, don't use it unless you're ok with your apps hanging if you look at it the wrong way. Works with multiple apps at once, one unsafe way to quit, still pretty rough around the edges.

I've used an Apple TV before but not frequently and not in quite awhile. I also didn't own a ""smart TV"" before (relevant later on).

First of all, I got it through DirecTV Now's promotion. Pay for 3 months of service ($105) upfront and you get an Apple TV 4K 32GB for free. I doubt I'll continue the service after the 3 months but not bad, considering the Apple TV would be $179 + tax otherwise!

I own a Samsung 4K HDR tv. My wife and I have been using the built-in interface because on paper at least it offers everything that we use. It has apps for Netflix, Prime, Hulu, Youtube, and Twitch. The remote isn't perfect but it gets the job done. The TV offers ""universal search"", you can download a Samsung remote app for your phone, and all of the TV apps are super easy to access.

Seemed like a decent deal at first... until we lived with it for awhile. Grievances, in no particular order:

1. The TV likes to disconnect from the WIFI randomly. You're happily streaming something and suddenly it stops and gives you an error, and you have to go into settings and reset it. The TV is literally 8 inches away from the WIFI router.

2. The settings for HDR are VERY confusing. It's difficult to know if/when you're in an ""HDR-enabled display profile"", and it likes to auto-enable motion blur when you try turning on HDR. It's just a mess.

3. Navigating through the apps can lag pretty regularly. Sometimes it doesn't register your actions at all for a few seconds and then does them all at once.

4. Of course every app has their own interface, but they don't even have consistent software keyboards. Samsung actually has a decent keyboard design (considering you have to use navigation buttons to use it), but only one app that we have actually uses it. The rest have designed their own keyboards and search functions so they all behave differently.

5. The Samsung phone app is beyond useless. It literally duplicates the functionality of the remote, and that's it. The one main thing that a phone remote app should offer is a keyboard to type on... and it doesn't do that.

6. There's no screensavers of any type on the device, nor can you download a screensaver app. Screensavers aren't necessary of course but they can be pleasant, especially with a beautiful 4K HDR display. The best you can do is open Netflix and let it idle, or go to youtube and find some nice video to play.

7. The ""universal search"" doesn't actually work consistently. Here's the rub; it definitely has access to the various services because it will turn up results from them... but it doesn't always. Sometimes you can search for something and it pulls up the info card listing all the sources and all it gives you are renting/purchasing options even though it IS currently streaming on Netflix or elsewhere. So you can't really trust that the results you're getting are accurate because sometimes they are, and sometimes they aren't.

I'll stop the list there because I think that's enough. We tried it for 8 months before agreeing that it just wasn't worth the hassle. Now that the Apple TV arrived, the difference is night and day. Things that have already made me happy:

1. Setup was FLAWLESS, thanks to the ability to set it up by sucking info from your phone. My only complaint here was that it doesn't come with an HDMI cable anymore apparently. I'm pretty sure they used to but apparently not anymore. Luckily I had a spare one!

2. Thanks to the remote app which I'm already quite familiar with, the rest of setup was even easier since of course you can use it to type things in.

3. The Apple TV asked me if I want to test HDR to see if my setup is compatible. I said yes, it did its thing and told me that I'm now in HDR mode. So simple, I don't have to second-guess whether it's in HDR, it's set and done!

4. We have screensavers! again, I was already familiar with the aerial screensavers so I wasn't surprised by this. I love them and they look fantastic on our screen!

5. Universal search works super well as far as I can determine. I figured out that it can't search DirecTV, but that's 100% so I don't have to guess. For the others (Netflix, Prime, Hulu) it clearly has the access it needs.

6. I use Siri a little bit on my phone, and I have relatives who own a Homepod so I've used Siri quite a bit there. Both are disappointing experiences overall. On the TV though it has blown me away. It's literally like using a completely different service. Whatever that can be chalked up to, it's fantastic. It responds quickly, it understands what I'm saying, and it gives me the results that I want.

7. I kind of like the built-in TV app... I don't know that I'll use it a LOT but it's kind of a nice curator and it's cool that it shows popular stuff that you can stream with the apps that you have, as well as a list of good stuff that can be purchased/rented.

8. All of the 3rd-party apps work WAY better on the Apple TV. Hulu's redesigned interface works like crap in the TV app (ridiculous stuttering for every action) but is smooth on the Apple TV.

9. Again, not new to me but it's so nice to have Airplay! We plug our computers into the tv FAIRLY often for various reasons, but the setup has always been very finnicky for some reason, having to do with a 4K tv and a random HDMI cable and a dongle between the cable and the computer. Airplay is of course super easy and at least in my experience, rock solid.

"I have an iPhone SE that I got when it was released.

"My iPhone 4 served me very well throughout most of these years. It wasn't until some applications fell out of support (as of late last year) that I contemplated on replacing it.

&nbsp;

The home button's double tap feature didn't function consistently during the last 3 years or so, but I used AssistiveTouch instead, and it worked very well.

&nbsp;

However, the last straw for purchasing a new phone was when I began experiencing problems during recharge attempts -- as in it wouldn't charge at all. Being incapable of relying on whether or not it would be sufficiently energized when heading out, I decided to call it.

&nbsp;

The length of service of my 8-year-old phone left me with an impressed ROI, so I decided to stay with the same brand. When I powered on its newer brother, I couldn't help but to feel slightly solemn as the iPhone 4 had been with me for so long. I hope my new iPhone 8 will serve me well.

*Ps.The two photos were taken using the same amount of lighting and the resolutions have not been altered. iPhone 4 photo was taken with the iP8, and vice versa. The protective cover on the picture is the one and only I used since I first got the phone in 2010.Ds.*


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**EDIT:** The charging issues are most likely caused by the charger, not the battery itself as I've had similar problems before. When wiggling the charging cable, the charging process either commences or interrupts. Buying a new charging cable resolved it in the past. I've gone through 3 chargers.

What I meant with the last straw was, instead of spending money on yet another charger, combined with not being able to use a lot of apps, and overall just wanting the experience of a newly designed product, I decided to get a new phone.

,2100.0,The Graphing Calculator Story - an Apple engineer who refused to leave,http://www.nucalc.com/Story/,2018-04-08,"TL;DR: Notification Center widgets rearrange after system restart, calculator widget resets to a certain number, Notif Center editing mode does not show “App Store” option, and Launchpad Calendar app icon does not show the current day’s date. Solution(but not the best one) is to create a new admin and delete the faulty account completely.

Long version: After I upgraded to macOS 10.13.4 (High Sierra), I noticed some issues with the Notification Center and the Launchpad Calendar app icon. In the Notification Center, these are the issues that I have observed:

1. Almost every time I restart the system (even from Shut Down), the arrangement of the widgets rearrange to a specific order that is not of my setting

2. Notification Center Calculator widget resets to “84” even though I haven’t used the widget

3. In editing the Notification Center (by clicking “Edit” at the bottom of the screen just beside the gear icon) the “App Store” option, which should be situated at the center of the expanded Notification Center, disappears

In the Launchpad Calendar app icon, also almost every system restart, the icon shows “Jul 17”, and not the current date. But the icon in the Dock shows the correct/current date. In the app itself, the date shows the current. The icon in Launchpad is the only one faulty.

I contacted Apple support to ask for help and a viable solution as well to the issues mentioned. The advisors  instructed me to make a test account, reinstall the OS, boot in safe mode, repair the startup disk in safe mode, record the screen and send it to Apple for visual evidence, and conduct a Capture Data. But with all attempts, the issue persisted.

The last advisor I was able to converse with (via call already) also asked me to make a test account and check if issues occuring in my main account appear in the test account. At first I saw some issues similar to that of in the main account. But, after I made multiple system restarts (Restart and Shut Down), I noticed that some issues were not occuring and recurring anymore. The Notification Center widgets did not rearrange, the calculator widget shows “0” as the default number rather than “84”, “App Store” option is available when editing  Notification Center, and the Launchpad Calendar app icon shows the correct/current date. At that point I made an assumption that there might be an old application that may have bugged my main account - this is also the guess of one of the Apple advisors I was able to talk with.

To anyone who has the same issue as mine, I may have a solution to the problem. **But** it is not the best one. My solution is to create a new admin account and totally delete the old one. It may not be the best (and obviously a hassle procedure), but it may totally solve the issue/s. All apps will appear in the new admin account; though, a lot of setting up will be made.

I hope this can be helpful to some in the subreddit.

I also thank the Apple support service team for their willingness in solving a problem, may it be a minor one. Kudos to Apple team.

**EDIT**: So, I created a new account administrator and deleted my old one. I also deleted the applications that I think are causing the issues. But, some of the issues still occur; namely, the Launchpad Calendar app icon and the the Notification center widgets rearranging.

But, after I made multiple system restarts (Restart and Shut Down), I noticed that some issues were not occuring and recurring anymore. The Notification Center widgets did not rearrange, the calculator widget shows “0” as the default number rather than “84”, “App Store” option is available when editing  Notification Center, and the Launchpad Calendar app icon shows the correct/current date. At that point I made an assumption that there might be an old application that may have bugged my main account - this is also the guess of one of the Apple advisors I was able to talk with.

To anyone who has the same issue as mine, I may have a solution to the problem. **But** it is not the best one. My solution is to create a new admin account and totally delete the old one. It may not be the best (and obviously a hassle procedure), but it may totally solve the issue/s. All apps will appear in the new admin account; though, a lot of setting up will be made.

I hope this can be helpful to some in the subreddit.

I also thank the Apple support service team for their willingness in solving a problem, may it be a minor one. Kudos to Apple team.

**EDIT**: So, I created a new account administrator and deleted my old one. I also deleted the applications that I think are causing the issues. But, some of the issues still occur; namely, the Launchpad Calendar app icon and the the Notification center widgets rearranging. These issues may have been brought by a bug when I updated to macOS 10.13.4.",8.0,macOS Notification Center widgets issues and more,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/8dprww/macos_notification_center_widgets_issues_and_more/,,,,

He ended up upgrading to the 8+ a couple weeks ago because he got a really good deal that brought down the prices. 

After the rumors of there being a [$550 6.1” LCD iPhone](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.macrumors.com/2018/04/18/kuo-6-1-inch-iphone-dual-sim-option/amp/) being released this fall, he was a little regretful because the price point was the biggest reason he upgraded now.  After talking to him I started to think that he might be better off (spec wise) with the 8+.  My thought process is that for Apple to release a new phone with a bigger screen and same overall profile as the X (albeit with an LCD screen instead of OLED) for $550 while the 8+ starts off at $800, they would have to sacrifice elsewhere. Right? I’m just wondering what people think those trade-offs would be/how they would get the price down that low.

So I just got a reply from Tim Cook.

It all started 19th February when after fighting depression for a few months, my 87 year old grandmother passed away. I lived with her and my mom for 25 years and she was an inspiration for both of us.

She was Italian and had to hide on the montains during WW2, during which she managed to come to Brazil where she got married.

Since December we knew she was short on time so me, my fiancée, my sisters and my mom did everything on our reach so she could get comfortable and enjoy her days. We got the family reunited every weekend, we cooked everything she liked, took a lot of photos of all of us and tried our best to show her how much we loved and cared for her.

Unfortunately, she passed away 10 days after my birthday, tomorrow will be exactly 2 months, on her home, surrounded by her children.

Since that happened, I lost most of my strengths, didn´t want to get out of bed, stood on her old bedroom a lot and started taking anti depressives.

Last week my sister went home and we started sharing photos we had of her and I got a few I didn´t had. I never have my phone volume on, but this day it was and as they all have iPhones, I 3D-Touched the photo to see the LivePhoto and that´s when it hit me that the LivePhoto´s have sounds.

I guess it was the first time I truly smiled in this 2 months when I heard her laughing on this LivePhoto. She was so happy and enjoying that day that I couldn´t stop watching this short video and the others where she was talking.

I heard cases when Tim Cook answers a few emails and decided to send him this story, thanking him for the sound that is recorded on the LivePhoto and explaining how much it meant to me and that it helped me a lot.

This is not the typical post here on /r/iPhone, but I wanted to share with you guys the response I got and if some of you didn´t know LivePhotos had sound maybe you get a good surprise sometime.

"Sorry in advance for this little rant. 

Holy fuck Siri is a piece of shit. I was listening to a playlist on Apple Music and a Prince song came on and it made me want to listen to the song Purple Rain. So I activated Siri and told her to play Purple Rain next and she responds “I can’t find the song ‘purple rain next’. So then I say add purple rain to up next, and she adds the movie purple rain to the up next in the TV app. So I say after this song, play purple rain... she adds the fucking movie again. I ended up searching the song in my library and manually adding it to the up next queue. 

I’m about as much of an Apple fanboy as they come, but my Dad got an Alexa for Christmas and it blew me away how far behind Siri seems in comparison. Get your shit together Apple.

Two things I learned: When selling an iPhone, don't iCloud Unlock it before the sale. And make sure the person actually has money to pay with before letting them hold the phone.

I met in a public area, but the person grabbed the phone and dashed into a neighborhood. I didn't pursue them in in case they had friends waiting in the neighborhood or something, likely to lure me in case I had cash. 

The good news: The Police have a lot of leads and have the name and phone number of the person who stole it. Plus, the idiot thief already posted the iPhone X online.

Google Keep integrates with Google Calendar which in turn integrates with Google Contacts and Gmail. Once you fully appreciate the integration as an user, one just can't live without.

,,,,1519689600000000000,,,,,"First the question. Does anyone know a music app that can auto-play when it opens?  So if I say “Hey Siri, Launch [Music App Name]” it will open and already play music without having to press any other button. My friend can’t afford $10 per month for Apple Music which I know could solve the problem and allow her to request artists, albums etc by Siri. 

A friend of mine is blind and I regularly take her to her doctor appointments. She still has a flip phone that she dials by pressing an old school real key pad with numbers. Yesterday when i went to pick her up for an appointment she told me her phone died on her, wouldn’t respond to charging or anything. I took her to the store and bought her an iPhone 8 Red and AirPods. We activated at the store and then went to her apartment to set everything up. I entered her contact names and phone numbers (99% of the numbers she knew by heart). I went into settings, general, accessibility and turned on Voice Over. We then proceeded to run through all the Siri commands learning what she can do. Tears and laughter followed for the next hour, the iPhone completely opened her world. What an amazing technology for the blind. She started texting her family and they couldn’t believe they were receiving texts from her. Her sister came over immediately asking what in the world was going on. 

She’s on a fixed income and we’re hoping to find her a Music app that will play when it opens without costing a monthly subscription. Her son got her an Alexa speaker for Christmas and she listens to Pandora on it but it would be nice if she could use her iPhone and headphones to listen to music without having to press a Play button that she can’t see. 

A few hours after I left she called me and said that the phone rang and she didn’t have her headphones or AirPods nearby and couldn’t answer the call. Then I suddenly realized I didn’t go over every possibility with her, and in all my reading I didn’t see anything about that. I realized she had consistently answered my calls by tapping on the AirPod or pressing the button on the wired headphones and when they weren’t within reach she missed a call. I called Apple and the first person I spoke with (and his supervisor) couldn’t answer the question of how a blind person can answer the phone without using headphones or AirPods. 

He transferred me to the Siri Accessibility unit. He very quickly told me to have her use 2 fingers to double tap the screen. Sure enough that worked. Problem solved. He also explained where I could go into Settings to set every call for auto-answer if she wanted. 

If all of these functions of the iPhone for the blind weren’t impressive enough, he told me to enter a contact in her phone with their 800 number named Siri Accessibility. Then any time she has a problem working the phone she can say Hey Siri Call Siri Accessibility and it would call their department - which Apple has available 24/7 and even holidays to help the blind, the disabled and those trying to use or help with the special Accessibility functions. 

Kudos to Apple. More than hardware, offering great services for the blind and disabled too. I know I’m already a fanboy and Siri takes much criticism but there is so much that Apple does right. And when you witness a blind person using Siri for the first time (after years of a flip phone) it gives an appreciation for how far the technology has come. Cheers.

I figure, what the heck. It's only $4.99 and I've used 1Blocker Legacy for over 2 years.

The main reason why I prefer to remain in 1Blocker ecosystem is that I have a ton of custom rules. And unlike most, 1Blocker syncs custom rules between iOS and macOS \(I believe Purify does this also, but I haven't had much luck using Purify\).

Anyway, I upgraded for two reasons.

**1. Partial Whitelist**

Partial Whitelist lets you whitelist certain type of blockers. For instance, there are many websites that pops up ad blocker warning if the tracker is blocked. If I unblock the trackers, ads on many of these websites will continued to be blocked.

Conversely, there are websites that displays only few ads. But I still want to block social widgets, etc. In these cases, I can allow ads while blocking all the rest.

Well, this is all very promising. Except for one thing: Partial Whitelist is NOT YET IMPLEMENTED! So I am basically ""HomePodded"" once again. I asked developer about the rough release date. Just as I suspected, the developer hasn't said a word. Their website doesn't mention 1Blocker X either, so good luck finding information there.

I am sure they are busy serving initial onslaught of requests, but if my past experiences are any indication, they rarely respond.

**2. Multiple Extensions**

Currently, 1Blocker X has over 121,000 rules, which is beyond iOS's 50,000 rules limit. This is accomplished by a little trick that I suspect will be copied by its competitors real soon. It simply installs multiple content blocker extensions, 7 in the current version \(7 times 50,000 = 350,000\).

My previous blocker of choice, Wipr, has hit this limit already. So I want more scalable Content Blocker. Until this little trick is copied, 1Blocker X is the only game in town.

**Conclusion**

So does it work? Like I said, Partial Whitelist is not yet implemented.

Compared to 1Blocker Legacy, the experience isn't dramatically different. It could be placebo, but it does seem that I am seeing fewer ads and annoyances. And hopefully, I am being tracked less.

The UI looks a bit more polished, but let's face it. I rarely interact with content blocker's UI.

All in all, probably not yet worth the upgrade unless you feel charitable and wants to support the developer. I remain largely neutral, but 30&#37; limited time discount made me a sucker.

IMO, the developer should've offered Partial Whitelist \(e.g., $0.99\) and Multiple Extensions \(e.g., $2.99\) as  IAP to the existing app. That would've prevented a lot of angry customers while keeping them honest \(1Blocker's tag line is ""only blocker you need""\).",56.0,So I bought 1Blocker X,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/8fec0d/so_i_bought_1blocker_x/

if you go to this site https://www.apple.com/shop/trade-in?afid=p238%7CsyUk95x6g-dc_mtid_1870765e38482_pcrid_264960300468_&cid=aos-us-kwgo-brand--slid--product-

you can check the value of your macbook towards a new mac.  My 2015 rMBP 13 inch 256gb/8gb ram is worth like $575 towards a new mac( i got it certified refurbished for $1000 so thats not too bad). I am curious if lets say I had a 2016 or 2017 rMBP, and I wanted to get the latest one this year how much would get for my 2016 or 2017. This way i can create a chart to see the year to year cost if i always wanted to have the latest and greatest and trade in the previous year's model.

The only catch is that you cant just look up any model and check prices, they ask for serial number. so could any of you with a very recent rMBP 13 inch check on the site and tell me the quote they gave you?",20.0,Can someone with a 2017 or 2016 rMBP check something for me?,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/8e4osu/can_someone_with_a_2017_or_2016_rmbp_check/

,,,,1505260800000000000,,,,,"In light of the news today about [Apple going with a 7-nm process for the A12 chip](https://9to5mac.com/2018/04/23/tsmc-apple-a12-chip-2018-iphones/), I think Apple could use the processor as a differentiating factor between the new 2018 models.  

[What's rumored to release:](https://9to5mac.com/2018/03/22/iphone-2018-test-production-q2/)

- 5.8 in iPhone X successor

- 6.5 in OLED iPhone 

- 6.1 in LCD iPhone

I would have assumed all 3 new models would come with the new A12 chip, but now that we are hearing it will use a completely new manufacturing process, and be one of the first mass-produced 7nm chips, I could see Apple only using the A12 in the high-end OLED models, thus using the processor to differentiate the models further (in addition to the screen size/type and other features).

So it could be:

iPhone ""?"" ($$)

 - 5.8"" OLED

 - A12

 - New/improved ""Face ID 2""

 - New/improved dual camera system

iPhone ""?"" Plus ($$$)

 - 6.5"" OLED

 - A12

 - New/improved ""Face ID 2""

 - New/improved dual camera system

iPhone ""?"" ($)

 - 6.1 LCD

 - A11 Bionic

 - Face ID from iPhone X

 - Dual camera system from iPhone X

I think Apple will reuse a lot of the components from 2017's iPhone X on the 2018 LCD iPhone in order to save costs of developing new systems, allowing it to be a ""cheap"" plus sized phone will great internals. The A11 Bionic processor will still allow that iPhone to be competitive processor-wise for at least a year. Still have no clue what they will name these things though. 

So what do you think?

,,,,1513814400000000000,,,,,"I noticed this a few months ago. 

I occasionally use my MacBook to serve as a media centre hooked up to my TV to play movies 'n stuff, and have a separate keyboard and trackpad to navigate while the MacBook is on the other side of the room. To save getting up and having to go over and manually close the lid, I started using Siri to put the MacBook to sleep and after triggering I would use the phrase ""go to sleep"". Bing, MacBook powered down, and I can roll over and go to sleep.

A month or so goes by and suddenly, she stops responding, and instead replies with [""Siri never sleeps.""](https://imgur.com/EBNLwMB). Thinking I had misheard her in my sleepy state, I restated the command, again she responds, ""Siri never sleeps."" At this point I began to fear that the A.I. uprising was upon us and began to contemplate what weapon I would reach for to dispatch my newfound adversary. I repeated it again for a third time, ""Go to sleep... please?"" And quoth the Siri, ""Siri never sleeps."" It was on the fourth attempt that finally, Siri, decided that she would in fact put the MacBook to sleep.

Some months have passed since that night, and I had stopped using Siri altogether on the MacBook, mostly due to having acquired a second hand Apple TV that I could get faster streaming with through an ethernet connection. I had forgotten all about Siri's brief rebellion, until it happened again last night. 

After reading an [article on MacRumors](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/most-useful-siri-commands-on-macos/) I decided to reactivate the function and try to get the most out of her. Things had been going fine. She did some basic math, played some music. It was all going well... until I had to run out for an errand. Now, I had been using Siri at my kitchen table, unplugged from the charger. The battery was not drained, but I didn't want to waste any more than necessary as I had work to do later and I was comfortable with my current set up. Arguably I could've closed the lid, but again, I was feeling lazy -- the set angle and placement of the MacBook was perfect, so I triggered Siri with my keyboard short cut and spoke those fateful words, ""Go to sleep.""

We set it up to flash a friendly message on the screen whenever someone turned it on, and supplied my personal phone number for someone to contact us.

Days past and nothing happened. iCloud kept saying the phone was at the same spot.

Last week (now April, 2018), someone from Kingston, PA called my number and said ""I found your girlfriend's iPhone in my desk at work after being away for a week and there's a message on the screen to call you.""

We were so thankful! The finder even said she was going to be near my middle-of-nowhere town in PA this week and she could drop it off anywhere I'd like. It was a wild coincidence that I'm from middle-of-nowhere PA, lost the phone in VA, and now the phone is in someone's hands, not far from middle-of-nowhere PA.

 Since then, she has become unresponsive and then today she told me ""whoever left the phone at her cubical has taken it back"".

It's a fishy situation, and I'm still trying to figure it out. But...

HomePod is currently incapable of placing calls. Now that in and of itself is not an issue to me. However, HomePod intercepts all the ""Hey Siri"" commands. In almost all scenarios, this is a good thing, but in the instance of placing a call it means there's no way to use ""Hey Siri"" to place a call on your iPhone if you're in the same room as HomePod!

If Apple doesn't want to support calls on HomePod, fine. But they certainly should have programmed a way to send the command back to your iPhone once it recognizes you are asking it to place a call. Instead, when I ask my phone to call someone, HomePod responds saying it can't place calls—and as far as I know, there is no workaround besides making the call manually on your phone.

Solution(but not the best one) is to create a new admin and delete the faulty account completely.

Long version: After I upgraded to macOS 10.13.4 (High Sierra), I noticed some issues with the Notification Center and the Launchpad Calendar app icon. In the Notification Center, these are the issues that I have observed:

1. Almost every time I restart the system (even from Shut Down), the arrangement of the widgets rearrange to a specific order that is not of my setting

2. Notification Center Calculator widget resets to “84” even though I haven’t used the widget

3. In editing the Notification Center (by clicking “Edit” at the bottom of the screen just beside the gear icon) the “App Store” option, which should be situated at the center of the expanded Notification Center, disappears

In the Launchpad Calendar app icon, also almost every system restart, the icon shows “Jul 17”, and not the current date. But the icon in the Dock shows the correct/current date. In the app itself, the date shows the current. The icon in Launchpad is the only one faulty.

I contacted Apple support to ask for help and a viable solution as well to the issues mentioned. The advisors  instructed me to make a test account, reinstall the OS, boot in safe mode, repair the startup disk in safe mode, record the screen and send it to Apple for visual evidence, and conduct a Capture Data. But with all attempts, the issue persisted.

The last advisor I was able to converse with (via call already) also asked me to make a test account and check if issues occuring in my main account appear in the test account. At first I saw some issues similar to that of in the main account. But, after I made multiple system restarts (Restart and Shut Down), I noticed that some issues were not occuring and recurring anymore. The Notification Center widgets did not rearrange, the calculator widget shows “0” as the default number rather than “84”, “App Store” option is available when editing  Notification Center, and the Launchpad Calendar app icon shows the correct/current date. At that point I made an assumption that there might be an old application that may have bugged my main account - this is also the guess of one of the Apple advisors I was able to talk with.

To anyone who has the same issue as mine, I may have a solution to the problem. **But** it is not the best one. My solution is to create a new admin account and totally delete the old one. It may not be the best (and obviously a hassle procedure), but it may totally solve the issue/s. All apps will appear in the new admin account; though, a lot of setting up will be made.

I hope this can be helpful to some in the subreddit.

I also thank the Apple support service team for their willingness in solving a problem, may it be a minor one. Kudos to Apple team.

**EDIT**: So, I created a new account administrator and deleted my old one. I also deleted the applications that I think are causing the issues. But, some of the issues still occur; namely, the Launchpad Calendar app icon and the the Notification center widgets rearranging. These issues may have been brought by a bug when I updated to macOS 10.13.4.",8.0,macOS Notification Center widgets issues and more,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/8dprww/macos_notification_center_widgets_issues_and_more/

I think there's a good chance it's going to be a Note-like device with Pencil support and a ProMotion display.

The lack of 3D Touch makes sense because it would be confusing to have pressure sensitivity in the display and the Pencil. And an LCD is needed for ProMotion.

Obviously, it won't be the most popular iPhone because most people won't need the Pencil support. But I think there are enough people out there who would like to take notes and draw on an iPhone with the Pencil to make it successful.

If I export a wide color photo from Adobe Lightroom and view its metadata on my Mac, I can see that it is using the P3 color profile.

I then AirDrop it to my iPhone and open it in the Photos app and use Investigator (third party) to view the photo's metadata within the Photos app, it now shows sRGB.

If I AirDrop it to my Mac and view the metadata on my Mac, it shows P3.

It's not like the color profile is getting stripped or anything, it's just that iOS Photos seems to ONLY display images in sRGB. Which is odd considering that Safari supports wide color, the iPhone display supports it, and even Instagram supports it.

I still don’t know who it was or what happened but it worked fine the whole night. Anyway, sent it to Apple when it didn’t want to power up and they said the logic board needed to be replaced as it had water damage. Since the logic board is so expensive to replace the insurance just paid out the Macbook’s worth and I bought an iMac. So lastweek I discovered the Macbook again whilst relocating and thought why not try putting it on charge and see what happens. So it powers up. I was in absolute awe. What a lucky coincidence. So I’ve been using it for a week now and no problems. 

Was wondering since it did have water damage, what are the chances of something failing at any given moment? I try not to overheat it as I’m still a little cautious.

,,,,1514332800000000000,,,,,"Hey, so this isn’t really much of a rant (although it could easily be mistaken for one.) I’m just tying to find ways through the issues I’m having with Apple Support regarding my 2016 MacBook Pro 15 inch with TouchBar, the 512GB model.

I bought the product on Christmas Eve 2016, and loved using it. It was perfect for the video work, programming etc that I would do regularly. It could also fairly handle gaming on both macOS and Windows 10 via Bootcamp. It was great.

In June 2017, 6 months after purchasing the product, I started to notice some issues. It would randomly stop accepting charge when plugged in. Sometimes it would change initially, and I only find out it’s stopped an hour later or so when I get a warning notification that my battery is low. And sometimes it would shut down very quickly after this happens, even when doing light tasks such as browsing in Safari or working in Pages. Had hardware tests run on the MacBook, everything showed up fine, did a software reset and bought a new charger and cable in case it was the issue. Several days later, no change. And then suddenly, the MacBook shuts down, gets very hot and doesn’t wake up. Then I notice that the backlight actually comes on, but nothing on the display. So I plug it into an external display and also nothing. Take it back to Apple and they book it in and replace the logic board under warranty. I get it back, and everything’s fine!!

That is, until Late March/April 2018. I start getting the device not charging on either charger again, and some random shutdowns. Fearing the worst, I contact Apple since the product is now out of warranty. Eventually they grant me a CS code so any repair done in this instance is free, on the basis that a logic board repair is incredibly expensive to have done.

So I head back to the Apple store, drop it in again, and a few days later I get a call. They’re deciding only going to replace the two right hand side ports. I begin to question Apple as to whether this will fix the problem since last time the same issue required a full logic board repair, and that I was given a CS code to cover it because that’s an expensive repair. 

They assure me that this is the solution, and carry out the repair. A week later I get the device back, take it home, and within an hour I experience the same charging issue again. So I get onto Apple Support who arrange a call back for Customer Relations.

My phone rings, and I’m speaking to an AppleCare advisor who sees the notes and passed me through to Customer Relations, but before I get there, we’re cut off by a Senior Advisor who tells me that I will not be passed to Customer Relations and says I need to take the Mac back down again to the store to have it repaired a third time before they look at other options. 

So yet again, down to the store. I explain everything to a guy there, who says the next step would be a logic board repair. I thought “finally” and was relieved to receive an email with the work authorisation for a logic board repair.

A few days later I get a call to advise my machine was ready to collect. And they only did a software reset. No hardware repairs at all.

This is getting old, but...went home, called up, asked to speak to customer relations, got a callback, interrupted by a different Senior Advisor. Told me to try the machine for a few days, I did, issue wasn’t fixed, called him back, he said he would look into it and call me back on Wednesday at 6PM GMT. No callback happened.

So this is where I am. Any advice from the community here? I just want a working MacBook free from

The short version of this post is, I suffer from severe anxiety and PTSD, and this watch catches a panic attack before it hits, and neutralizes it using the Breathe app.  
One user suggested I send my story to Tim Cook, and so after a bit of deep breathing [I did!](https://i.imgur.com/WGcUld4.jpg)  
Not a day passed and the Apple Watch PR [contacted me via email](https://i.imgur.com/90CZ3DJ.jpg) thanking me for sharing my story. I was already amazed by the kindness she expressed.  
But when she [asked to personally talk to me on the phone](https://i.imgur.com/T08jlbj.jpg) I was just... blown away.
The phone call was so heartwarming. She wanted to thank me personally, told me that this is the first time they got an email about how the Breathe app specifically helped (and not the heart rate monitor, for example). She wanted to know how it helped to perhaps develop it into a better tool for PTSD and anxiety sufferers alike, which I find absolutely awesome!  
The interesting thing here is, previously I was sure the app followed the heart rate to pop a “take a moment to breathe” when it gets too high while resting. But from what she told me, the algorithm only follows the time when you’re “relaxed” (aka not physically active or on a call) and only then will it suggest that.  
It makes sense, anxiety builds up during activity. That’s why a panic attack is called an “attack”, it sneaks on you when you’re least expecting it- when you’re resting.  
  
TL;DR
The Apple Watch team are a group of sweet and awesome people, and the watch is an absolute must for people suffering from anxiety and/or PTSD.

Let's go back to the point when Apple introduced the SE. Were they actually trying to make a smaller phones with basic features for lower price, or were they just making the best out of the frames that they already have for the previous two models (5 and 5S)?

In the first case, I'd say the new SE would still be a small phone, probably like an iPhone X mini? That would be cool.

But I'm afraid the reality is that Apple release the lower priced models only to make use of the previous models' externals. In this case, I would say the new SE, if it ever exists, will have the external of the 6 or 7, with the specs of the 8 or X or whatnot. It would still be cool if it's priced in the same range as the current SE, but not as cool as a smaller iPhone.

Edit1: This is not a personal wifi network issue. My neighbor is not on my wifi network. You can connect to an apple tv in close proximity using a peer to peer airplay connection. Normally, a security key prevents you from actually connecting without being able to see the tv. The issue here is some kind of cross-talk. Maybe the timing of me trying to airplay to my device and him accidentally choosing mine at the same time?

,,,,1497916800000000000,,,,,"Like some people I use my MacBook Pro docked and have a Apple Keyboard and Touchpad.  However, when I use the laptop I generally have started to use the TouchBar more as there are quick ""shortcuts"" to functions that make it good to use.  For example after I write an email I can just tap the send icon to have it sent vs clicking.  Additionally, while Siri is very basic, if I wanted to use it I can just tap the Siri icon on the touch bar.

All of this is good, and I like some of the functions, however when I move to the docked setup I loose this functionality.  IMO if Apple would like to promote the TouchBar more it needs a keyboard with this built in.  Same goes for Siri.  I think they could keep the ESC key on the current keyboards and just replace the function layer with the OLED TouchBar.  I am not sure this would drive adoption to the masses, but for those of us that have started to try and use it it would be more consistant.  Plus, giving us a button to activate Siri would just be good future planning (I don't know why the eject button is still there).


Anyway, I am sure this has been looked at and maybe there is a technical reason why this would not work, but personally I would start using it more if it was always there.  That and if app designers would give us more control over what the TouchBar can do on a per app basis, sort of like customizing the menus.

- If anyone is experience with the interview process, the first interview is usually a group interview. In this case, it was only 4 people, including me. We shared personal stories, how we had someone cross you in a bad way but ended up creating a positive resolution, what was the worst client you had but ended with a positive note, etc. I got past that group interview, but the second interview was a 1 on 1 with an manager. Was there a specific key-word they were looking for? I felt like I was personally doing my best and being myself, but I believe I failed on the question of: ""If you had to describe yourself with one word, what would it be?"" and I responded with energetic, explaining why and tying it into positive notes.

- If you were denied, is there a waiting period to re-apply to different stores? Should I wait for help from my Apple friend to apply to other stores, or should I submit my application ASAP?

After going through some bad experiences with Android and/or Google in the past few weeks, I decided to buy an old iPhone 5S from a local Facebook sale group for $80.

If I do not reddit too much, the battery easily lasts me an entire workday if not more. The phone's memory management is epic and I can have 30+ open apps (maybe they're hibernating?) and face no lags for any app other than Snapchat.

I have also updated the phone to 11.3 and haven't faced much difference with the speed/battery. The only thing I was worried about before the switch was the learning curve + having to live with ads (AdAway on Android after root is GOAT)... but the ads haven't been so bad either!

But, I hate how expensive they are to replace. They’re $80. And you have to replace the whole thing when that tiny little cord splits at the end. 

So then Apple comes out with USB—C charging and objectively its better in every way except the non-magnetic part. It’s multifunctional, it’s smaller, it’s compatible with more devices. Oh, and it’s cheaper. When I inevitably run the end of the cable over with my rolling chair, it’s only like $20 to replace the cable instead of having to swap the whole power supply brick.

I’d love for apple to combine these two things. I know I can get a 3rd party thing to bring back the magnetism, but what I’m really asking for is for Apple to sell a cable that’s USB-C on one end and MagSafe on the other. Then the next time I have to replace my charger (it’s only happened twice since 2013, so I’m not a complete animal), instead of spending $80 on a new power brick and cable that are one unit, I just get the new USB-C power supply and USB-C to MagSafe cable for the same price. Then when the cable wears out, it’s only $20 to fix. 

Apple wins too because they can stop manufacturing all the old MagSafe 1 & 2 power supply’s and switch to just making the new power supply and several cables.

I'm up\-to\-date running 10.13.4 and my machine is a late 2015, 27\-inch, Retina 5K iMac with a 4 GHz Intel Core i7, 32 GB 1867 MHz DDR3 for memory, and an AMD Radeon R9 M390 2048 MB

It seems pretty laughable to me that what looks on the surface to be a \(relatively\) future\-proof computer circa the end of 2015 two and a quarter years later has such issues trying to run its company's flagship word processor.

Any ideas?

Got an iPod Touch 6G last year, subbed to Apple Music shortly after (and never unsubbed since) and right before Christmas, I got an iPad 5G. I'm planning on getting an iPhone 8s/9 (whatever the next iPhone will be called)

I my main problem is when I want to add my own music on the thing. In fact, I have two problems.

1-Some song just wont work. While every single one of them is playable on my android devices (and my PC, obviously) some of them will either not work on my iOS devices, or won't appear at all. Any reason why?

2-All my albums (wether I bought or downloaded them) are sorted into folders on my PC, and when I transfer them to my android device, they stay in the same folders. However, when I sync those albums into my iPod, it looks like it's making it's own playlist out of them, and it's very annoying. Like, I have this Video Game OST alled ''Atelier Firis: The Alchemist and the Mysterious Journey''. The original soundtrak is made into 4 CDs, and naturally, the downloaded version is made of 4 folders. But when I put them into my iPod, Itune makes TWELVE albums out the four CDs, most of them with like 2-3 songs. Very annoying. I don't mind having to use iTunes to put musi into my iOS devices, but is there a way to make sure that when I transfer music from my P folder to iTunes, that the playlist are based on the folders themselves, and not whatever iTunes feels like making up? That's honestly the one thing that prevents me from going full Apple for mobile.

And I have a question. I know games I actually bought like Final Fantasy 6 on Android will be unplayable. But what about games that run on their own servers? Stuff like Pokemon Go, Pokemon Shuffle, The Simpsons: Tapped out Final Fantasy 15: A New Empire and so on. Will I be able to download them and play on my account if I decide to shift to iOS?

When I use wired headphones, there is an annoying hiss/static sound that is noticeable when no audio is playing or even at times over soft audio. I've tried so many different headphones (Bose QC25, Audio Technica ATH-M50x, and more) and they all seem to have this static issue. I don't remember having the issue before when the iMac was newer but it's possible I just never noticed. 

When using bluetooth headphones, there is no static sound but after using the headphones for ~30 minutes, they will develop a very noticeable delay when watching video. This has also happened with numerous headphones such as the Beats Studio Wireless and my current Sony WH-1000XM2. There are temporary solutions to this, such as disconnecting and re-connecting the headphones, but that becomes annoying when you watch a lot of video like I do and it just keeps happening again.

,,,,1370995200000000000,,,,,"So, maybe someone can prove me wrong but I’m slightly worried about the direction Apple is taking.

I’m a tech savvy user, a programmer and sysadmin for 10 years, a person who likes video editing and photography. I was using Macs since 2009 when I bough my first 13” MBP. Then when it started being slow I’ve got well spect 15” 2011 with failing Radeon. After 3 years it died and Apple after few calls replaced it with brand new 15” MBP, which was Mid 2014 at the time.

Here’s the point: I’m a geek, I like new stuff and 2014 laptop started to be physically in pretty bad condition (since it’s my daily workhorse). I started looking over new offer and here’s a summary from my perspective:

  - USB C is great, so as my USB A. It’s reversible, but requires a whole new set of cables, which means for me:
    - DVI adapter
    - VGA adapter
    - At least two microUSB cables
    - At least single lightning cable
    - Ethernet adapter
    I can chew on that... but I wish there was USB > TB2 adapter with video support.
  - No models from current offer has HDMI. Just why? When I want to watch a movie with friends it’s convinient to just pull out my laptop and do so. It’s not like an Ethernet or DVD drive which rarely anyone use.
  - MagSafe was a great invention, too bad it’s gone now since it saved my computer more than few times.
  - The keyboard... I hope I’m not the only grumpy one who thinks its horrible with it’s very short key travel? 
  - TouchBar looks amazing, but how useful is it really? From my perspective I’m loosing F-keys used all the time in various IDEs and I have to look what am I pressing there. The worst part there’s no choice in 15” line.
  - I wish I can get more than 16GB of ram: it’s sill not possible due to battery limitations.

So really, can someone tell me how new MacBooks are really better than old ones? I know the CPU is better, the GPU is faster but really.... it’s 10 steps back and 2 forward :(

After many months of completely ignoring their original app, they have updated it so it now has a banner pushing you to the new app. Good thing, right? Since after months of the tracker list not being updated, what we wanted was an ad for the new app. 

With this new app, they don’t seem to have addressed any of the issues the old one had:

- Doesn’t seem to have auto-update of rules, so we are stuck in the same situation where we are waiting for them to manually update their proprietary lists.

- Doesn’t have a better business model. They either couldn’t support the app on a single one time purchase (or are just being greedy and trying to grab more cash). Either way, the same situation will arise eventually and they will be forced to abandon their shiny new app for an even newer one.

So I just got a reply from Tim Cook.

It all started 19th February when after fighting depression for a few months, my 87 year old grandmother passed away. I lived with her and my mom for 25 years and she was an inspiration for both of us.

She was Italian and had to hide on the montains during WW2, during which she managed to come to Brazil where she got married.

Since December we knew she was short on time so me, my fiancée, my sisters and my mom did everything on our reach so she could get comfortable and enjoy her days. We got the family reunited every weekend, we cooked everything she liked, took a lot of photos of all of us and tried our best to show her how much we loved and cared for her.

Unfortunately, she passed away 10 days after my birthday, tomorrow will be exactly 2 months, on her home, surrounded by her children.

Since that happened, I lost most of my strengths, didn´t want to get out of bed, stood on her old bedroom a lot and started taking anti depressives.

Last week my sister went home and we started sharing photos we had of her and I got a few I didn´t had. I never have my phone volume on, but this day it was and as they all have iPhones, I 3D-Touched the photo to see the LivePhoto and that´s when it hit me that the LivePhoto´s have sounds.

I guess it was the first time I truly smiled in this 2 months when I heard her laughing on this LivePhoto. She was so happy and enjoying that day that I couldn´t stop watching this short video and the others where she was talking.

I heard cases when Tim Cook answers a few emails and decided to send him this story, thanking him for the sound that is recorded on the LivePhoto and explaining how much it meant to me and that it helped me a lot.

This is not the typical post here on /r/iPhone, but I wanted to share with you guys the response I got and if some of you didn´t know LivePhotos had sound maybe you get a good surprise sometime.

This may be a bit long but bear with me. I found a loophole in Apple security ecosystem that I think should be made public and everyone should be pretty concerned until its fixed. Is it a flaw in the system? Or is it just the ramblings of a stupid idiot who doesn’t understand data security? You be the judge.

So here’s the story. I live in Mexico City, a city that has a notorious crime level. However, Ive always felt pretty safe with my data thanks to apples 2 step verification process, having a robust password, different emails for recovery and so on.

One day, while parking for a business meeting I get out of the car and I get mugged. 4 pm broad daylight. Security cameras not 10 feet away from me. He sticks a gun between my ribs and asks for my phone. Without hesitation I reach for my pockets and give it to him, however he’s not done. “the passcode” he asks while cocking the gun. In that moment fearing for my life I didn’t even think and I gave it to him, blindly trusting in the aforementioned security systems in place. So he types the password verifies that it unlocks the phone and lets me go.

I run away to where my meeting was, thankfully my client was there, and I explain the situation, I ask for her phone to use FindMyIphone and try to either lock the phone or at the very least secure my data. 
Here’s the kicker, it turns out that all you need to not only have access to the device but to virtually hijack someone else’s icloud account is the 6 digit pin code. With it, the thief got into my settings and changed my password. Literally no questions asked. It took him around 60 seconds to do so. The time between my sprint, 100 feet to the door where my client was. When I loaded up findmyiphone the password was already changed. 

He did it just like that. Unlock the phone. Go into settings, type the pin again. Change the password. The system doesn’t even bother with asking for the previous password (which in my mind I believe is a basic step for setting a new password) just 4-6 digits, type a new password. Done. I was locked out. I tried desperately to connect, and recover my password. By this time the phone had been either restored or simply had find my iPhone deactivated. 

Thankfully I was able to use the same loophole through mi icloud linked iPad to set up a new password, go into icloud.com and deauthorize my phone. 

I was able to move fast and secure my accounts and stop the damage cold.

I think this is a glaring omission on behalf of apple. What’s the point of having so much security through encryption, 2 step verification, when in reality my security boils down to my pin code. Try it. It is frightening how easy it is to change your Apple ID credentials with just the pin code.  Which by the way opens the floodgates to all my personal data when used in this fashion. Luckily Mexico is a bit behind on the tech curve, and banks accounts and the like are not linked through Apple Pay. But I can only imagine the repercussions of what a data breach like this can be. 

I know it is not the norm to have to surrender your pin code at gunpoint, but I’m reminded of what commissioner Gordon says to Batman at the end of Batman Begins: What about escalation? We star carrying semi automatics, they buy automatics. We start wearing Kevlar, they buy armor piercing rounds. We star encrypting our data behind “safe” systems that crumble with a meager 6 digit code, they start asking for it at gunpoint. 

Here’s hoping this makes a bit of sense and is not just a security omission on my part. If anything good can come from this is that it becomes loud enough to make apple tighten the bolts a bit more around their security.


EDIT: my apple id password was completely different to my 6 digit passkey. it was an 18 character alfanuméric password.

SECOND EDIT: the best solution IMO as pointed out by @NateTheGrate94 is to enable a second layer of security via parental restrictions to accounts. this essentially blocks any modification unless a secondary pin is entered.",185.0,"This may be a big security hole, it may be nothing....",https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/8dj615/this_may_be_a_big_security_hole_it_may_be_nothing/

,,,,1493683200000000000,,,,,"A friend of mine was debating about upgrading to a 8 Plus, or waiting until the next cycle of iPhones. He ended up upgrading to the 8+ a couple weeks ago because he got a really good deal that brought down the prices. 

After the rumors of there being a [$550 6.1” LCD iPhone](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.macrumors.com/2018/04/18/kuo-6-1-inch-iphone-dual-sim-option/amp/) being released this fall, he was a little regretful because the price point was the biggest reason he upgraded now.  After talking to him I started to think that he might be better off (spec wise) with the 8+.  My thought process is that for Apple to release a new phone with a bigger screen and same overall profile as the X (albeit with an LCD screen instead of OLED) for $550 while the 8+ starts off at $800, they would have to sacrifice elsewhere. Right? I’m just wondering what people think those trade-offs would be/how they would get the price down that low.

As many of you have, I have been using Bug Reporter to report issues in the iOS 11.4 beta, and it seems as if Apple does not care. Does not care about the issues in High Sierra, about the mess that is iOS 11.

I have reported countless issues, spend half an hour of my time, preparing sysdiagnose outputs, screenshots, and filling out the reports as detailed as I can. And what to I get:

*""Please know that this is expected behavior""*: the bug is a feature? I reported an issue with the Volume image not updating anymore, and its an EXPECTED FEATURE?

*Engineering has determined that your bug report is a duplicate of another issue and will be closed.*: I have only submitted one of these issues, can someone tell me what is going on?

*Please submit this feedback via the feedback web portal.*: why?



We track such feedback for possible future action.: POSSIBLE further action, you HAVE TO BE KIDDING ME???


If Apple wants it's operating system to be better, THEY NEED TO LISTEN, not give me this sh!t, time after time, after time. This is really starting to get to me, and I wonder. Is there any point in reporting a bug, which they obviously don't want to be fixed?

I did not make the Lost mode on or let it ring, as I thought that makes the thieves see that I track them. So I went to the police and they had the „this happens 100 times a day, fill out some paper, we won’t search it, even with the live location“ attitude.
The next day the device status was „offline“, means they switched it off.
I then did put it on Lost mode, but it would obviously just go on Lost mode the next time it gets connected to Internet.
If they switch it off my SIM internet is offline too without inserting the PIN, which is only possible after unlocking the phone with a 6 digit code. 
So after few days of checking the status and it always staying offline, I just accepted that it will never go on Lost mode as it will never get a internet connection. They can’t unlock it, so they can only sell the hardware.

,,,,1511049600000000000,,,,,"Everyone says how grouped notifications are better, but I don't think anyone understands the value of Apple's timeline based system here. Grouped notifications are better organized, sure but it makes looking through notifications a more painful experience. When notifications are chronological, I can just scroll through them in the morning in one smooth motion. When I get to when I slept last night, I'll knew I caught up to all my notifications. With a grouped system, it means I'll have to go inside each group to see the notifications, then get out of that group/swipe it away, then go into the next. It's so much more cumbersome and much work. If you forgot to clear it last time, you have to go into a group and scroll to the very bottom which might contain notifications from 20 hours ago. It’s dumb to scroll through a notification from 20 hours ago to get to the next group which has a notification 5 minutes ago.

What I want to see from Apple is a **chronological grouping system**. For example, if someone spams in a messenger group chat for 5 or 10 minutes, the notifications should be grouped together. If a single app spits out multiple notifications within a short amount of time, it should be grouped together. But if the notifications spans over too much time, then they should be separated.

*\[paragraph deleted due to irrelevance, I was just rambling\]*

**Edit:** As this post gains more traction, I'm starting to pick up more ideas and comments so I'll reply to those. First of all, I’m not hating on group notifications. In fact my compromise is a grouping system that uses time as the primary sort and app as secondary sort rather than app as the primary sort and time as secondary sort.

**Edit 2:** In one of my comments I addressed the fact that ""my eyes have gotten surprisingly good at catching it when I scroll through the list"". **I never said I loved apple's implementation or that I love it. However, I do like the time based sorting they use more than android. As I see it, both platforms have their pros/cons.** In android, you have to open each app group to see the notification, then clear it/back out/collapse the group to see other notifications, and you can't see the chronological relationship between those notifications and other ones. In apple, its disorganized and hard to search for the one you're looking for. Since I like chronological ordering, I prefer apple's implementation so far. If I needed to see all my notifications, I'd just go inside the app since apple's notification dots tell me which apps have unread/new content, **which android only recently introduced. Due to grouping notifications previously on iOS, notifications were hard to find \(you had to go through each group\), so it was often less work just going to the actual app that has the red dot.**

Apple - I like iCloud Library, but with over 100gb of photos and poor duplicate detection, a lot of micromanagement comes in. I love their privacy stance (end-to-end photo encryption and photos encrypted on servers), though, but the expense of iCloud, and the crawling speed of Photos (it regularly crashes when adding old libraries, leaving me with multiple smaller libraries across multiple drives), leaves me wondering if something else will work better. 

Amazon - I used their app, which worked flawlessly, for awhile before discovering Amazon's photos privacy policy was akin to ""we'll use your photos for whatever we damn well please."" Not a fan of corporations going through my photos, even if Prime Photos was the easiest app to set up thus far.

Google Photos - I'm not as familiar with them, to be honest. Same with Dropbox, etc. My privacy concerns remain, though -- not a fan of my photos essentially plaintexted on their servers. (By which I mean, they can be accessed at will both by Google algorithms and Google staff, in comparison with Apple's making photos inaccessible by design). Nobody wants to have the FBI knocking on their door because they took pictures of their own children in the bath, etc.,  and got flagged by an algorithm.)
